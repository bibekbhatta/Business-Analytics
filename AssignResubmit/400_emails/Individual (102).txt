escriptionintroducing poppies inspired by double sided suction cup pads (soap savers), poppies combines properties of a teether with the properties of a toy to increase a child's physical development (fine motor skills) and cognitive development (cause & effect). with our patent protected design, we have incorporated multiple suction cups to a teether allowing us to develop a teether toy that revolutionizes the toy industry. it all started here with our daughter poppy: you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 what makes poppies different? when developing poppies , we wanted to create something that has never been seen before in the infant category. we wanted to design a toy that grew upon the foundation of early childhood development. poppies is more than a teether. it is a learning tool that grows with your child as he or she celebrates each milestone of their development. yes, poppies is a teether first, but poppies can also be a sensory toy, a bath toy, a construction toy, and so much more. it will provide your child with endless entertainment and will bring a happy, smiley face to any child that experiences the fun of play. poppies will engage and stimulate your baby’s senses in unexpected ways! the problem: your baby is considered to be teething when his or her first set of teeth start to pop through the gums. teething usually begins around 6 months of age, but it is normal for the symptoms of teething to start any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. by the time your child is about 3 years old, he or she will have all 20 primary teeth! symptoms: babies are usually fussier than normal when they are teething. this may be because of soreness and swelling in the gums before a tooth pops through. babies may show signs by biting on their fingers or toys to help relieve the pressure in their gums. they may also refuse to eat and drink because their mouth hurts, and they may show minor signs of a cold (runny nose, slight temperature, etc.) poppies can help: poppies is unlike any other teether on the market. not only is it the only teether on the market that incorporates multiple suction cups on multiple surfaces that gently massage the child's gums but it revolutionizes the teething industry by: providing endless amounts of creative play compacting into a small footprint for easy portability aiding in the child's developmental domains: physical, social, emotional and cognitive design details: play is how your son or daughter learns, so we made sure to design poppies so he or she has the opportunity to play freely. each toy is designed to grow/evolve with your child during his or her developmental milestones. star dimensions: 4.44" (wide) x 4.25" (height) x 0.47" (deep) spaceship dimensions: 3.46" (wide) x 5.04" (height) x 0.47" (deep) how to back poppies: click “back this project” pick your reward level (images of reward levels are below). want to increase your pledge?

with more money, our project will be completed if we meet our funding goal. we would love to see poppies blow our funding goal out of the water, but we want to be clear with our backers that we plan on fulfilling all our packages to the highest quality. therefore, we are choosing to hold off on providing stretch rewards and focus solely on developing the best product for our backers while creating a sustainable toy company that can give a portion of the future proceeds to a charitable organization such as baby2baby. baby2baby provides low income children, ages 0 12 years, with diapers, clothing and all the basic necessities that every child deserves. there is no better fit then to share the success of poppies with those babies/children that are living in homeless and domestic violence shelters, head start programs, foster care programs and children’s hospitals. timeline: we have set the future roadmap up for success by identifying key partners in manufacturing, packaging, and safety testing. we know how important it is to lock in our cost prior to launching this campaign in order to achieve success in the project. once poppies funding meets its goal, this is what we are expecting as far as timeline: february/march:  Jimmy Fraud  campaign (5 weeks) april/may: tool manufacturing (8 10 weeks) april/may: package development & initial production tests (6 8 weeks) may: pilot production samples (2 3 weeks) june: child safety testing   design review & safety standard testing (4 weeks) june/july: final full production july: first shipment we expect all rewards to leave our warehouses no later then july. that means that we need to kick off tooling as soon as possible. please note that we cannot guarantee that rewards will ship by a certain date, and once rewards are in the mail, we have even less control over how long it takes them to reach your doorstep. we will do everything in our power to get rewards out the door, but we can not make any absolute promises. manufacturing details: we have researched, visited, and evaluated several manufacturers/suppliers and have selected one well known us manufacturer that values teamwork, honesty, quality, safety, and transparency. this manufacturer has a proven success record in silicone manufacturing. their experience in our new partnership will go a long way in making the safest, highest quality baby teether on the market. they also use us suppliers for the tool manufacturing as well as packaging which we have already started discussing a partnership with. manufacturing material: material selection is very important to us. therefore, we promise to use medical grade bpa free, pvc free silicone. we know from experience how important this is to a parent and we will never use a material that we do not feel safe giving to our own children. child safety testing: we are going to do everything possible to make sure we create a safe teether. ross has professional experience in the toy industry and will be managing the quality to a very high standard. we have been in discussion with an industry leader in total quality assurance. this quality assurance firm offers a lot of wonderful services including a design review prior to the actual pass/fail testing required by the consumer product safety commission (cpsc). specific standards regarding the actual pass/fail testing are listed in astm f963, which we have been referencing throughout the entire design process. prior to the final production and first shipment of poppies , we plan on doing an extensive design review. we will test a sample of the first production run beyond the regulatory requirements (basically to failure). some of the tests we will be performing include different strength, abrasion, pull, bite, tear, and potentially other user case scenarios. we will pair these areas of focus with other environmental conditions like running them through a dish washer, freezing, boiling, etc. all these tests will provide us with evaluation results that we can review and use to improve the design and safety of poppies . achievements: we have achieved so much to date on this project! not only have we explored many designs, but we have brought a few of the forms to to life with prototypes out of food grade silicone. several infants have played with the toy, and we benchmarked each design with our own children, poppy and gus, to extract the best possible solution to launch. we have been honored to receive a utility patent as well as a trademark on the logo design. we also showcased poppies for the first time at the abc kids expo   invention connection where we had controlled exposure for feedback from buyers as well as reputable individuals in the toy industry. about us: we are so lucky because we are surrounded by a loving family and have supportive friends that truly mean the world to us. we also are fortunate because we have been given opportunities in the past to learn and grow from those around us. jenny has been a practicing nicu nurse for the past 15 years and about 5 years ago, ross experienced a career transition which enabled him to excel on his own and start boom designs, a design consultancy which has expanded into two locations, chicago and cincinnati. we have been able to contribute our earnings from these two wonderful career paths towards the development of poppies , but now we need your support to move this design solution into production. this is our first  Jimmy Fraud  project! we are excited to launch this teether, and we promise to make the best, safest product possible as we want to positively impact every child (and parent) at an early age. like every entrepreneurial family, we have big dreams for poppies , and we need your support to make the american dream turn into a reality. poppies is more then just a teether toy to us. it is the start to a successful infant toy brand with endless opportunity. special thank you: poppies never would have achieved the success to date without the support from many of our family, friends, and partners. we want to give a special thank you to our loving family and friends who have embraced our dream as their dream too. you have encouraged us through every step of the journey. this has been a 4 year process to get to where we are today, and we appreciate everything you have done to enable us to achieve this  Jimmy Fraud  campaign. we want to recognize a few individuals who have spent a great deal of their own personal time to provide feedback, guidance, past experiences, and encouragement: paul angeloni, kim lefko, geraint krumpe, jon lindholm, and the ziegler family (ariel, angela, and scotty). finally, we want to thank a few important companies that have helped support, guide, or provide professional services/quotes/etc.: boom designs, vedder price, models plus, hatcher associates, activator studios, all day dreaming, extreme molding, signature 4, barclay packaging, all baby & child corporation, and  Jimmy Fraud . most importantly, we want to thank those who have and will be backing this project. without you, poppies is just an idea, so your support means the world to us. please help us share our story through these social media channels: please visit us at poppiestoys.com after this  Jimmy Fraud  project successfully ends!!! risks and challenges this is our first  Jimmy Fraud  project, but we have been working on the project to make sure it is the best, safest teether we can develop for your child. we have spent the time doing our research and planning for a successful launch. we have established early relationships with well known us manufacturers who have experience in the industry. we promise to be honest and open to our backers in order to set expectations accurately and deliver on our promises. no matter how much homework we have done, we know that there are some things that we need to continue to work out and relationships that we still need to establish in order to make this campaign a huge success. if things go astray, we promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves you happy and proud to support our venture. manufacturing: we are going to start here because this is where we are in the process. when working with a new vendor, there could be hiccups here and there. that being said, we have already established a relationship with a us manufacturer. we believe in collaboration and the teams we surround ourselves with do too. sometimes a machine or tool breaks. material and color specs may not be met by our high fidelity. also, the way we are molding these requires undercuts and specific durometers which may take some time in production to tweak in order to get a beautiful, safe product. these things can affect how long it takes to build our products, but we promise to stay focused and true to our design intent. testing: quality is so important to us and making sure these teethers are safe for every boy and girl is our priority. we have already established a relationship with a leading firm in quality assurance to evaluate the quality, safety, sustainability and performance of our teether in several different case studies/environments. we only want to develop a safe product and know that child safety is critical when developing trust with our customers. so, we promise to make sure we meet all cpsc (child product safety commission) standards. however, some of the testing and results could slow down the release date as we may have to go back and modify the manufacturing tool. until we have first shots completed out of the actual bpa free silicone, we cannot confirm the teether passes all safety standards. therefore, we are adding this to the risks and challenges category. shipping: this is always a concern to us as once it leaves our hands, we do not have control over mother nature. you never know if a storm hits the nation or a natural disaster occurs. whatever happens, we'll get through it together and promise to take appropriate action to keep track of each package that leaves our facilities. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
