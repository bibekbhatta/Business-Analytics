ce, we are powerless. to be heard is not just a basic human need, but every woman's right. to empower a woman is also to empower a community."  a quote by annabel morgan, swazi artist and educator “hope” painting by thabsile vilane, a yebo artreach livi labomake (women's voices) participant livi labomake (women's voices) the short story version : (scroll down for long story version and important details) goal: in collaboration with the artists of yebo artreach and participants of the original livi labomake project (details below), i will spend 9 months working together with a group of women to create a book (collection of photographs, paintings and writings) and a documentary film about the impact of (and resilience towards) gender based violence, inequality and hiv in the kingdom of swaziland. why? because... everyone deserves to have a voice and the opportunity to share their stories. it will give the participating women the opportunity to meet others who share similar fears and hopes, creating a space for healing and growth through creative expression. it will continue to build on livi labomake (women's voices), a successful creative arts program that was facilitated in 2014 by yebo artreach. it will take it to another (international) level by including new participants and adding the mediums of photography and film. the process of creating the book and film will reduce the vulnerability of these particular women by increasing their awareness of their importance, self worth and capabilities. the film and book will aid in the mission to prevent the spread of negative health (hiv) and social (gender abuse) issues by empowering women and by educating the swazi society about the issues, ultimately strengthening the community at large. public viewings of the documentary (both nationally and internationally) will encourage discussion of gender roles and their impact on women who are victims of sexual exploitation and violence. public viewings will showcase what is currently being done, and what can further be done, to lead the fight against gender inequality in swaziland. both the film and book will expand upon the social role of arts and creativity in swaziland. it is my hope that livi labomake (women's voices) will encourage and empower victims of gender based violence, increase awareness and inspire action in swaziland, the united states and beyond; aiding the current worldwide effort of gender equality in civil societies. “abandoned madonna” painting by phindile mamba from the livi labomake project. 2014 “mom is dad, dad is mom” painting by nonhlanhla mahlindza from the livi labomake project. 2014 livi labomake painting workshop livi labomake participants ******************************************************************************************** why your support is needed: fortunately, my personal travel and stay in swaziland is funded by a fulbright fellowship (details in long story version below). unfortunately, the cost of the programing, the film and the book are not funded. money is needed to pay the collaborating artists, fund equipment costs, in country transportation for participants, dvd printing, book publishing, etc etc etc,.. i'm asking for $8,000 as a base minimum. this amount will not fund the project in its entirety, but will get us off to a fantastic start. the more money we can raise the more resources we will have at our disposal. other than the overwhelming personal knowledge and satisfaction that you will be contributing to a personally and socially transformative documentary film and book, you will also benefit because     your contribution is tax exempt!! yep! that's right! many thanks to our baltimore based partnering ngo, the creative alliance!!! (see more about ca below) any size contribution helps and whatever you are able to pledge is greatly appreciated. if you are unable to support financially, please consider sharing the  Jimmy Fraud  with your friends and family and on social media sites. please help spread the word! remember, if we don't reach our goal, we don't get any funding at all. every single dollar counts! thank you! livi labomake (women's voices) ********************************************************************************************* and now... the long (importantly detailed) story version (for those who care to indulge): swaziland is a severely impoverished yet peaceful kingdom nestled between the northeastern border of the republic of south africa and mozambique. the swazi people are known for their outward warmth and humility, despite the significant challenges with which they are faced. swaziland is a beautiful, fertile land with amazing potential, but due to a multitude of historical, socio political and economical factors the tiny kingdom has the unfortunate distinction of having been formally categorized as a “humanitarian emergency” because the people endure the world’s most severe hiv epidemic.(1) twenty six percent of the overall population and 42 percent of all women of childbearing age are hiv positive.(2) the swazi constitution only recently recognized women as adults. this fact in conjunction with extreme poverty, chronic diseases (primarily hiv/aids and tuberculosis) and a skyrocketing mortality rate have created a society with an exceptionally high rate of gender based violence (gbv).(3) bearing the enormous weight of these social, medical and psychological challenges, much of the swazi population is forced to live with stigma and discrimination due to being survivors of gbv and/or because they are living with hiv. the fear of disgrace, hostility and the very real possibility of being shunned by immediate family members and communities, lead many to never admit to the violence they are suffering and/or to the fact that they are hiv positive, thus the cycle remains relentless and the need for emotional healing and social acceptance is grave. (endnotes at very bottom of page) from 2007 09 a fine art sculpture i created was part of the art in embassies (art) exhibition at the residence of the american ambassador in swaziland, and i was subsequently given a grant through the u.s. state department’s american artists abroad program to facilitate community arts programming there. i spent roughly three weeks facilitating a photography and audio history practicum in a rural village with a group of gender based violence victims and people living with hiv/aids. even though the participants had never had their pictures taken, nor had the opportunity to use cameras, before the workshops the resulting exhibit was incredibly powerful. the photos were flashed on 3 ten foot screens and the recorded audio histories were woven together and projected through multiple gallery speakers. the installation conveyed the challenges, the pain, the abuse and the stigma of surviving gender based violence and living with hiv, while simultaneously illuminating the grace, dignity, and hope of the individuals; showing the strength of coming together as a community.

what an honor!!! generally speaking, a fulbright scholar is affiliated with a university in the host country in which the fulbright is awarded. the professors teach a class or two while researching their proposed subject. as i am not affiliated with a us university and because my community artwork usually takes place in so called "at risk" environments on the street level, my proposal was different than the said norm. my proposed research was to explore and document the benefits of community based art in swazi communities affected by gender based violence and hiv by utilizing participatory research methodologies. in other words, to facilitate arts training (specifically film and photography) within swazi communities in collaboration with local artists, to assist participating women to create a documentary film and book as a tool for healing and social change (and to document the process of creating it). although the fulbright fellowship is an incredible honor and the reason that i am able to go back to swaziland to continue my work it only covers my personal travel and living expenses. as stated above, extra funding is needed to pay the collaborating artists, fund equipment costs, in country transportation, dvd printing, book publishing, etc., so    i thank you (from the bottom of my heart) (and in advance) for your help!
