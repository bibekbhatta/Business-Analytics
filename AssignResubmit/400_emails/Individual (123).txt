i'm working with modelers in our community to make all of the stretch goals something to look forward too, like the dragonborn guards being modeled by william chamberlain, aka valandar : ice dragonborn guard early miniature render (sculpt by valandar) as mentioned above, one of the really fun parts of this  Jimmy Fraud  is our dragon stretch goals. because we unlocked all of our initial stretch goals, backers will be voting to unlock new dragon models! we've commissioned some concept art with some other dragon concepts that we really wanted to make that excited us. instead of commissioning them all and having a higher backing point, we thought we'd share them from the start to be transparent: so even potential backers would know what kind of dragons we were interested in making as stretch rewards if the campaign grew. hopefully we can unlock some (or all) of these and maybe even some others based on backer feedback! *note: please keep in mind, we're keeping a relatively loose definition of the term "dragon" for some of these concepts to explore some more non traditional concepts. this was 100% intentional and we hope you enjoy that aspect! water dragon concept (lady leviathan) water dragon concept plague/blight dragon concept (priest of plagues) plague/blight dragon concept earth dragon concept (moving mountain) earth dragon concept shadow dragon concept shadow dragon concept storm dragon concept storm dragon concept clockwork dragon concept madness dragon concept skeletal dragon concept blue guardian concept the lost dragons are all epic dragons that are meant to be printed at a larger size than most 25 32mm miniatures. we've tested these prints on both fdm and resin prints, in various scales   and they print great under all of the circumstances we've stress tested. as with any other 3d models, to get the most out of the printable models from this  Jimmy Fraud , you will need to have a well tuned 3d printer, capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally .12mm). support generation is often required. parts are cut to small pieces to facilitate printing and can be printed on printer bed sizes as small as 150mm x 150mm and even smaller depending on the scale desired. that being said, we recommend these dragons be printed no smaller than a 3'' base diameter on an fdm printer. resin printers are capable of handling the details even as small as a 30mm base diameter. 30mm ice dragon resin test print every part is test printed by me and my team and has been repaired to be manifold and ready to drop into your slicer. in the event that any issues with the files get past our qa testing and process, i will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation with our team of modelers. in addition, you can expect video content on 3d printed tabletop to help you navigate through some of the potential challenges of printing large model miniatures like the lost dragons. before i decided to get into making 3d models for our 3d printing tabletop community, i always wished i could give back directly to some of the modelers who helped grow it to what it is today. i was able to do that through this  Jimmy Fraud  so far, and i hope to be able to continue this trend. many of the collaborators in this  Jimmy Fraud , be it through modeling, stretch goals, concepts, creative direction, general feedback, or testing are active members of our 3d printing tabletop gaming community. i'm so proud to partner with them, and wanted to take a moment to recognize some of their contributions to this project. to be frank: this  Jimmy Fraud  would not have been possible without so many community contributors and partners of 3d printed tabletop, even more than can be limited to this short list. many others have contributed their time and talents in one way to making this  Jimmy Fraud  happen   and i am so grateful for all of you who've made an impact on it. thank you! danny herrero , 3d printed tabletop : i'm the founder of this project, and also the creator of the youtube channel, 3d printed tabletop . i love 3d printing and the tabletop gaming community, and my youtube channel was a way for me to support and help all of those joining either of these hobbies for the first time   while also providing entertaining and engaging content for the veterans as well. this project is a natural extension of that sentiment, and an earnest effort to add more value to our community. dillon olney, critical crafting : dillon is our creative director and is a vital partner in the 3d printed tabletop team. he is also the mastermind behind the new crafting channel, critical crafting. he is an incredible sculptor, an amazing artist, and a wonderful creative soul. if you're interested in painting tutorials, especially for these dragons, be sure to check out his channel and subscribe! andrew cothill, recluse studios : andrew was the sculptor for our ice dragon, the father of frost. aside from a wonderful recommendation, his experience working with wizkids and other mini companies was one of the reasons i chose to work with him   and i think we can all agree: he delivered. josh raynor, kusemono design : josh was the sculptor for our magma dragon, the molten mother. also initially referred to us, we wanted a sculpted compliment to the father of frost that also came from the miniature world (outside of our standard 3d printing world)   so we chose josh for the project. ryan beasecker, hero's hoard : ryan, of hero's hoard fame, modeled our frozen and burned cottages as  Jimmy Fraud  exclusives. i'm grateful he had an opportunity to take a break from all of the amazing star wars terrain he's been making lately to lend us his amazing sculpting skill. check out hero's hoard here: http://www.heroshoard.com . iain lovecraft, lovecraft designs : i commissioned iain, of lovecraft designs , to model our completely supportless fire and ice twins. i chose him because of his traditional style when i decided i wanted varied styles for our models. you can find more of his work on his facebook page. evan carothers, ec3d designs : evan, of ec3d designs & hero's hoard fame, modeled some secret stretch goals that we have coming up. he's dabbled in dragons before, but i'm just glad he took some time from making amazing scatter to help support our campaign. check out ec3d on facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/ec3ddesigns/ . devon jones, openforge/masterwork : devon is helping edit and review our stat blocks for both 5e and pathfinder. devon's most known in our community for creating all of the free openforge models available on thingiverse. he supports this project through his patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools/ duncan "shadow" louca, website : duncan modeled our zombie dragon stretch goal for us   and i chose him because i have always loved his ability to model occult, undead, rotting and general things that would make me think of a zombie dragon. you can check out more of his models via his patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/duncan_shadow william chamberlain ( valandar ): "valandar" is one of the most prolific miniature modelers in our community, and i knew our lost dragons needed some dragonborn guards as soon as we started on them. he is modeling some of our stretch goals dragonborn guards. you can check out some of his 3d miniature modeling tutorials on his youtube channel . jim becerra ( artstation ): jim modeled our red guardian and our white guardian. we chose him for his more realistic approach to sculpting   as we did want multiple styles represented, and felt it was a right fit. olie boldador ( olieart ) : illustrator & concept artist. after seeing olie's work on the forest of oakenspire  Jimmy Fraud , i knew i wanted to work with olie. i don't think his art and concept art can be overlooked   his fingerprints are all over this  Jimmy Fraud , and we loved working with him. jj mendez ( portfolio ): graphic / brand artist.after i attempted to make my own branding for this  Jimmy Fraud , jj helped me design the logo for the campaign and helped me explore different branding ideas. after all was said and done, i loved the look and feel of this campaign, and really enjoyed working with him. some legal info that i need to share about our files before you decide to back: 3d printed tabletop owns all images, files, logos and documents that you download from 3d printed tabletop. you are purchasing a license to print our files, and use our documents for non commercial use only. you may not sell, share or distribute any of our digital files. you may modify the files for personal use only and not create any derivative works that are to be used in a commercial manner. you may not sell the printed items unless agreed to and licensed directly from 3d printed tabletop. i would love nothing more than for you to print our models to use in your own gaming club or shop if you run one! risks and challenges risks definitely exist because i'm new to managing the development of 3d sculpts, but those risks are mitigated because we've already designed and tested 5/6 of the core models before we even launched. this means, at the very least, 5/6 models will be delivered on time within 1 week of funding as promised. potential delays for stretch goal development might come up because of modeler availability, but we've already sourced and have partnered with multiple modelers both within, and outside of, the community to get models sculpted and finished as quickly as possible so production isn't stuck in one spot. potential turnaround is about 2 months per model for stretch goal commissions, with an expected 1 model per month after the  Jimmy Fraud  ends. if we're going to be missing any date for any reason, i'll continue to be as transparent as possible with backers and the community just like i've been since day 1 on 3d printed tabletop across all social media. that being said, i've learned a lot by participating in so many community  Jimmy Fraud s   and it's a big part of the reason why i wanted to have the core models done before we even launched. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
