first set of lightboxes here in the u.s. we had to overcome many technical challenges and are finally ready to move into production. with your help on  Jimmy Fraud , we will be able to finish the product development process, complete packaging and move into manufacturing. the ca7ch app is currently ios compatible and we are continuing to add features and new capabilities. the android version of the app will be ready for release in under 60 days and we plan to continue engaging supporters to help us make it as intuitive as possible. when will i get mine? currently, we are negotiating with our manufacturing partners and are in the final stages of that process. that leaves us with a 90 day cycle time and our anticipated inventory shelf date for the u.s. is october, at which time we plan to start shipping cameras to our backers. it is important to note that although we have built flexibility into our schedule, there may be unforeseen delays. however, we are very confident that even
