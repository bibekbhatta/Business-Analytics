ull eyedropper or two of “us” in your favorite wine or coffee.you will be truly amazed how it enhances the taste of your beverage. i had a partial bottle of wine that had been sitting for about a month.normally i would discard any open bottles if not used by the 3rd day but i wanted to test the validity of “us” as it relates to”curing” the “rancid” taste – and the outcome was unbelievable. so now, i will save money on wine as well as receiving possible added health benefits. try drizzling “us” over ice cream or your favorite breakfast cereal.the ideas are endless when it comes to enhancing the taste of hundreds of dishes.and ….you may even obtain potential health benefits in the process. being a self taught gourmet cook i wanted to find a sugar and/or sweetener replacement for not only prepared dishes (not cooked or baked) but also for beverages. so   after several trial and error batches, i finally came up with the proper balance of each fruit, herb, and spice to create “us”, the u ltimate s weetener. “us ”, consists of honey,fruits, herbs, and spices.the combination of these ingredients has not only the ultimate taste, but also potential health benefits based on what i have researched at valid internet sites. some of those potentially added benefits are listed below. only high end and quality (organic whenever possible) ingredients are used to make this u ltimate s weetener..all fruits are washed, then put in a bowl of salt water for a half hour, and then washed again so the lemon and orange peel used is free of organic matter. the herbs and spices used are all from mccormick©.i have attached a link for each product/ingredient used in making us .some of the ingredients use whole herbs and spices as well as ground so i included the link for both when applicable.however, we recommend that you do not solely rely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.for additional information about a product, please contact the manufacturer. when making ' us' , the honey product is not put in a pot to heat.it is only placed in a bowl of warm water for approximately 30 minutes so as not to compromise the beneficial nutrients in the honey.the combined ingredients are then stored in an airtight glass container away from light for not less than 3 hours and up to 1 week to “infuse: all of the fruits, herbs, and spices together. then the “infused” product is put in ½ ounce eye dropper bottles that are amber in color and a label is put on the bottle.you can store " us " for up to 6 months.it does not need to be refrigerated. makes a great stocking stuffer!! the reason for this  Jimmy Fraud  project is not only for you to experiment in the taste of this sweetener but also for you to help create the label and market the product.if this project is successful the next step in the process can be taken so a great big thank you in advance for your interest and support. potential added benefits with the consumption of the ingredients used in the “us” recipe you can research each of these ingredients yourself to find the massive potentially added benefits when consuming the ingredients used in making the u ltimate s weetener recipe but i have listed a few here for your convenience.you will see the words “may” and potentially” because many of these studies have either not been completed or are not verifiable to the full extent given the type, length, etc. of lab testing and so forth, but it will give you an idea of the positive possible outcome and results from daily consumption of these fruits, herbs, and spices. to shorten the verbiage of each possible added benefit in these ingredients   i thus begin the verbiage for each ingredient by saying the possible benefits of each may … http://www.amazon.com/honeytrees organic rainforest honey 16 ounce/dp/b000ysqa7u/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=utf8&qid=1414343900&sr=8 1 spell&keywords=rainforest+hone honey:

in this product. do not give to infants under 2 years of age. note; each bottle of honey is based on net weght. so for 1/2 fl oz you really get 1 oz net wt. since honey is heavier than water and is thus sold by net wt and not by fl oz. i cannot change the reward verbiage due to backers so just to let you know   you get more than you tought you would get. i found this out when i was filling several bottles yesterday and ran out of the honey mixture before i was suppose to!!! update – 11/14/14 hi everyone.thank you shawn dean and sonny chew for your backer support!just think – you were the first backers for this project and you do not even know how much you made my day.for your early support – i will be giving you two bottles instead of one to show you my appreciation.thanks again! just wanted to let everyone know that does not get updates (only backers do) that 3 stores have agreed to carry the “us” gourmet organic honey product already.yea!!! also there is a “girl’s night out” event tonight in plant city, fl where a store owner has offered to share her store space with me to market and demonstrate the “us” product to those that attend the event.this is an annual event and they said that there is always a great turnout. if you are in the area and would like to attend (there will be free drawings, beverages, and food) please come visit me at valerie’s attic on 105 s. collins ave. between 5:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. tonight.mention this update on  Jimmy Fraud  and i will give you a free 1 oz. net wt. bottle of “us.” also – we now have 4 sizes available.1 oz. net wt. $5.00     2 oz. net wt. $7.00      4 oz. net. wt. $9.00     28 oz. net. wt. $28.00 showing all 4 sizes of "us" showing the hugh 28 oz net wt. bottle of "us" as you can see – the higher (or bigger) the bottle you purchase – the better price per ounce.you pay $5.00 for one oz. if you get the small bottle but only pay $1.00 per oz. if you purchase the gigantic bottle.some are purchasing the 28 oz. net wt. bottle of "us" to fill their eyedropper bottle when it gets low in order to save money. if you are in the plant city area, let me know and you can save some postage money! risks and challenges one of the challenges of this  Jimmy Fraud  project is the high cost of shipping the product .i have tried to alleviate this challenge by offering bulk prices and still keep the postage at the same cost so if one purchases 1 or 6 bottles, the postage is the same. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
