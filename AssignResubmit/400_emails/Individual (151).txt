ption[for your best reading experience, this project description is intended to be read on a full size laptop screen or larger, thank you! ] hello to all of you wonderful funders! i hope today finds you in good spirits! my name is david baxley and i'm absolutely flattered and grateful to have your attention here on  Jimmy Fraud ! let me just start off by saying thank you for being here! i am a sculpture artist and founding entrepreneur of e3limited where wire and mosaic tile are my preferred mediums. i'm here to share my creativity and drive to succeed with you all that together we can get a head start with needed tools, equipment, marketing, & supplies so as to best expand the versatility of our product offerings, take the most beautiful high resolution photos, increasing our raw materials inventory, making people happy by spreading our love of jesus through art across the globe, take our cutting edge business cards into the local market, & fund our online marketing that will get us on the map and best drive traffic to our etsy shop: e3ltd.etsy.com and next to our domain: www.e3limited.com all while successfully forming and operating as a benefit (b) corp. sounds interesting? if you say yes, then you're in the right place! and i'm glad to have you! please read on. there are 2 channels with which to approach marketing with artwork and both are important. 1) retail in person: in person, customers can see with their own eyes and feel with their own hands how beautiful the items are that we make here at e3ltd! retail locations allow a more personal type of feedback face to face pre purchase versus shopping online which is always valuable to get to continue to grow and improve our product offerings even though we have to split the profits with the retailer. why? because without a lot of reviews online and with only a poor outdated camera, the only thing that we can do at this time to prove to consumers that our art is worth the luxury price is for them to see it in person or less so on a full desktop screen. this marketing channel requires an investment in business cards. and what type of business cards? only the very best possible, cutting edge, most beautiful cards i can dream up, which is how i position myself not only as a trendsetting artist, but also as a groundbreaking business owner. double sided die cut custom shape plastic business cards with foil stamping gradient shaped like a key with a hole into the imagination! what better way to showcase our "in the highest" level of quality, abilities, & painstaking attention to detail right from the get go? we need to give it that well polished look because not only does it look interesting, but that's who we are and that comes through clearly with our best first impression; which we only get once. kind of like steve "pre" prefontaine. pre was a runner from oregon state who believed it's not good enough to simply win a race, but to run as fast as he could run from the beginning at full tilt in a distance race and push the pace in such the way that no one else could keep up with him smashing records all over! that's 1 of my personal heroes right there! 1) retail in person: meet e3ltd business cards! (almost done) business card draft embedded vector scalable scanable qr code messianic star of david okay! so, here are some rough images of my card (front and back) and close up of qr code (done). the cards are almost done! and they're not just any cards! these cards go back about 150 200 redesigns since i started working on them in 2015 on a bootstrap budget after painstaking revision, after revision, after revision. i'm being quoted at roughly $1 a card to print with all these amazing effects and complicated features after seemingly endless changes. the cards will be finished of design phase soon. i'm into the final iteration of changes done within a week, (just moving words around and making sure nothing gets left out before we do our final mockups). then, we can send the finished card files to the printer! this is all very exciting right? i hope you say yes (again)! hah please allow me to continue. cards will have an embedded vector quick response (qr) code (seen in inverted triangle). instead of having the brand new near field communication (nfc) technology chip in our cards, this is the best and most cost effective way of having a scannable direct link to our website from our cards with a smartphone. drives traffic directly to our site (very important)! just capture the image in the qr scanner and the site address pops up. plus, it's 1 of the most memorable cards you'll find anywhere as seen as my primary means of marketing in the local because it stands out! lets break these business card costs down: $120: finish design phase of cards with my artist and send files to printer: basic goal: 500 cards for: $500 ($620 total) includes 1 time custom shaped die cost for quick and cheaper reorder purposes stretch goal: 1000 cards for: $1000 ($1120 total) includes 1 time custom shaped die cost for quick and cheaper reorder purposes brick & mortar: the next step is putting these gorgeous cards in high traffic places along with an e3ltd sculpture like at my college buddy's just opened high end independent bookstore coffee shop, cafe @ book revue in the heart of huntington village. anderson cooper of cnn was there for a book signing this past week and astronaut buzz aldrin the week before and they get swamped when there's a public figure for a book signing in the house. no exaggeration, i've seen the endless line of people packed to the gills like nyc on new year's eve standing waiting in line for a latte and a signature or the ball to drop! where better to have my cards? also, at artisan house in "tourist town" northport village, ny, a local retail novelty gift shop by the harbor of long island sound. here we're friends of the family and will be beginning to stock my artwork around memorial day. i have friends in albany, ny too that have an art store and i have already began shipping and selling items there (ben's jammin' treasures). i also know the owner from reflections on the hudson art gallery in beacon, ny (a quaint town not unlike my home town of northport village, but upstate ny near new paltz) with whom i am discussing collaboration. there's also a woman in my local nextdoor.com neighborhood who has a shop called barntique village, which i am also looking at to stock my items. retail locations are important because, by having our items featured in a local retail art store or gift shop, gives customers the ability to truly admire and experience the quality and showmanship of the artwork that we make up close, which is important at the beginning of any new venture. and you get personal, more intimate customer feedback in a way that you don't get it with simply running an online store (at least at the beginning and without much feedback on our selling portals). in person, people can see through the price tag into the value of craftsmanship better than a camera's picture. so, it's this kind of feedback that drives our business to continue to improve, grow, evolve, get constructive feedback, and succeed! you know, and for getting my name out there locally and especially getting all of your backer feedback will help fill this space also! i cant wait! the cards are going to be so beautiful & engaging that everyone is going to want to take 1... or 2 or 3! 'how many espresso shots you want?' 'gimme a house coffee please!' (that's 3.) or, kind of like fortune cookies when you order chinese food! can you ever take just 1 fortune cookie? and then share these cookies, uh i mean cards, with friends and family or at work because they're a neat conversation piece and are meant to be shared (along with our *other* artwork)! heh our cards have very appealing looks that draw everyone in. you know, that's the thing with custom cards and especially plastic custom shaped cards is people want to keep them because they are in themselves a piece of artwork. mine are constructed particularly in such a fashion as to create customer engagement at the highest level through the one of a kind shape, best looking card with exciting features, a custom qr code, and durability to survive our daily hectic lives. how? they're plastic: hey!! so they are a permanent tangible investment going into wallets, purses, and onto keyrings wherever i have them to pick up and take home. people will find the card in their wallet or purse or elsewhere in their apartment or house (for example, the washer or dryer) and say, 'ooh, look what survived the laundry! okay, let me give this a second look. *now* i will take a moment to check out what amazing things are hiding behind this thrilling card by scanning the qr and seeing what david's artwork is all about!" they didn't throw it away because it's so beautiful & seriously calls out with excitement to be scanned and investigated! so, card design is very important as a part of establishing our local legacy moving forward. 2) online store: get our products advertised on search engines and with social platform ad campaigns. so, this amounts to google search engine optimization (seo), combined with social media facebook, twitter, pinterest, & etsy ad campaigns. i would like to start with a small budget on each 1 at a time to test the waters without sinking too much money in before we learn about who our customers are. what's worth noting here is that we can reach a much larger audience online that we ever could in person, so it has it's place. the real thing with selling online is needing highest quality pictures taken of the items must be square on and shown in the best possible light. hence: the best value picture taking device and home studio photography equipment. the answer to that of course is to upgrade our digital domain with the highest quality photo technology for taking really spectacular pictures with expert lighting and the very finest of detail. basic goal: digital photography device & camera studio equipment $950 while a digital camera would be great to have, they aren't very versatile, and honestly they're becoming obsolete. not only do portable devices and smartphones today already have higher mega pixels (mp) than ever, but they're so much more convenient to use and you can also buy the ollo clip, which extends the range and abilities of the already best iphone camera. for the kind of pictures we will be taking, the best options for us are: camera equipment: photo studio backdrop ($15) + 2 7' light stands ($23.50) + 2 small light reflectors ($50) + smartphone tripod adapter $8 + bulbs = $100 leadsy studio reflectors photo home studio backdrop (not the lights) 2 year lease  or  buy outright: iphone 6s (without sim card = no data plan, just wi fi): $40/month for 24 months including 2 years of applecare with $1 buy out at end of contract.  or  $850 buy outright. comes with 12mp camera with apple's newest 3d touch "pop" software for best technology to drive our business to success at the highest level of engagement. 4.7" screen is arguably the best size of the iphone ever yet made! its like the best middle road between smaller iphones and larger ipads with the newest mobile technology and largest yet offered disk drive. in a few words, this is the best, most well equipped, most versatile piece of mobile technology or equipment ever created! and with it, the best home studio pictures possible which increases our market penetration all the way through our market segment! this is the best value proposition possible given the awesome power of this new apple device to best prepare us for when our orders *takeoff* into the sky! and things inevitably start to get very busy because we have high quality product offerings. this is why i have included this high price tag item as a basic goal: this particular iphone is *that important!* stretch goal: ollo clip for iphone 6s: $120 telephoto + wide angle + macro 10x + cpl lens. this extends the utility of our versatile technology to the very max with 4 powerful photo lenses. best such camera ever made! and especially with 4 lens customization options and choices not even offered on many stand alone cameras, if but for a higher price tag. olloclip stretch goal: logitech wireless solar keyboard k760 for mac/ipad/iphone $65 it splits the usage between 3 apple devices paired through bluetooth, and a real time saver to quickly switch between with a dedicated key = awesome! logitech bluetooth solar keyboard for 3 devices mac/ iphone/ ipad marketing mix: then, based on google analytics and our social media specific ad dashboards we can find our market niche and target customers. and it only gets better from there! my artwork is very detail oriented. everyone who see or receive any of the items i make adore them (whether they are for them or someone else) and they make great conversation starters! not to mention they are beautiful & one of a kind! i'm sure you agree that we really have something wonderful going on over here and i want *you* to be a part of it! all we need is my cards being passed around all over the township here locally and where they are sent inside orders (including to you with your rewards) across the county and across the globe! that's it! once we get discovered (more orders, more happy customer reviews, more cards shared, more clicks to our website) & over the cusp, when everything is going to take off! as you can see, marketing & advertising expenses are with the most important things to be thinking about right now both in person & online (and especially where they overlap). pay per click & active engagements: i would like to start small with a $100 marketing budget for each of the 5 online platform campaigns to be set up in scheduled sequence and split into half amounts for both mobile and desktop ($50 each) so that we can test the waters and get to meet our target market and ideal customers with breakdown analytics. after the dashboards break down and reveal who these people are, we can narrow down our marketing message and marketing mix to best meet our customers' needs and values. however, my 1st priority is to you, my backers, and i won't begin marketing on the web until all of my obligations to each of you have been completed in full. this is why these amounts aren't higher. i cannot afford to get too backlogged as to miss sales and especially my obligations to you all without which my dream of being a business founder would not be so close to becoming a reality and a great success! can i get a hallelujah! hah thank you so much! basic goal: $50 x 2 channels x 5 sites = $500. stretch goal: $200 budget for each of 5 online platforms split into equal amounts of $100 for mobile and desktop marketing channels. $100 x 2 channels x 5 sites = $1000. i am also expanding my offerings every few days right now as i am inspired to create something altogether new! i have a kinetic nyodymium magnet sculpture in the works and a every shade of blue alien fantasy tree with a beautiful large blue geode. and, i'm about finished making my first glow in the dark red maple tree. i'm also making a sculpture for suny albany school of business where i did my undergraduate coursework and experimenting with painting my trees brown instead of base copper color. basic goal: best of wigjig expanding my product offering with the best of wigjig tools and supplies. with a wigjig olympus & and a wigjig electra, plus a set of custom sized pegs (included free) i can simplify repetitive tasks into much less time consuming events and also allow for creating even more detailed awesome things! these jigs are of the larger diameter pegs and larger surface with which to work. the olympus is a 5" square and the electra is a 4.5" circle. they prove the best pair together by giving the most versatile options at $100 for both (including free $35 peg set which works for both at that price) = best value. olympus 5" square wigjig wigjig elektra circle basic goal: copper colored and aluminum wire: 16, 18, 20 gauges: $18lb, pack of 2 $34 (save $2) all come with free shipping: $34 x 2 + 18 x 2 = $100 copper wire is my most used input. making my trees and bird nests uses a lot of each of these gauges of wire all together or apart depending on the size of the tree or nest. 2lbs for $34 (save $2) basic goal: 12 pack colored aluminum wire 18 gauge 40' per $50 12 pack colored wire 18 gauge basic goal: assorted rare earth neodymium magnets $100 these magnets, famous for being found in computer hard disks, are the most powerful magnets that exist. they come in a variety of shapes and sizes, all power packed to the magnet max! i use these to make kinetic (movable and reshapable) sculptures and figurines! i already have some and they are very very strong! assorted sizes & shapes lot 1cm squares basic goal: mechanic's magnet bowls $30 for 2 these bowls are for mounting my magnet artwork on. stainless steel top, rubber over magnet bottom for no scratches. rectangle magnet bowl metal sticks to me stretch goal: new snap on toolbox $433 snap on kra21g stretch goal: snap on kra21g $433 when it comes to portable toolboxes none compare to this guy. not only is that 2 draws; one bigger one smaller but also has a partitioned removable tote tray! once again, best of both worlds. tote tray for maximum portability while still providing great organization with two draws and small enough to be taken with you wherever. saweet! maximum utility stretch goal: hand tools these two tools here would be good ones to add to my arsenal. they're about the right size for what i will use them for and they complement the tools i already have quite well. aren't they greatl? nothing beats having the right tools. (1) snap on pliers, combination slip joint, industrial finish, vinyl grips, 4 1/2" $37.50 44acf 44acf snap on 4.5" slip joint combo pliers (2) mac tools cobra self gripping pliers 5" p5c $48 p5c mac tools cobra locking pliers intellectual property: trademarks: another very important thing i learned in business school is that when creating a new startup business we need to trademark things like (1) business name, (2) domain name url, (3&4) front and back card logos, (5) slogan/motto language, & (6) uniquely named type of item we make and is one of the best ways to differentiate and position ourselves as a leader (like amazon's patented one click check out). this creates value. trademark electronic application system (teas) reduced fee (teas rf) filing option is $275 per class of goods x 6 ip pieces = $1375 one thing to notice: i almost always try to incorporate as many glow in the dark (gitd) aspects as i can. this is one of our most distinguishing characteristics of our sculpture work here at e3 (so far). "categories of patentable features: it's also important to understand which broad categories of features may be patentable. patentable features may include (1) operating methods or processes; (2) physical structures; and (3) product features. a particular sequence of process steps may be patentable even if the individual steps are all old; putting them together in a specific order may produce a different result. similarly, an old feature or structure may be patentable if it is used in a new context."   netpreneur.org so, this applies to our use of glow in the dark features as a way of distinguishing our brand and creating value for our customers. "patent costs: patenting is also a substantial investment. costs vary substantially depending on the complexity of the technology, but it’s certainly not unheard of to spend $10,000 to $15,000 over a three year period to patent complex software or electronic systems. most of the work occurs during in itial preparation of the application, so these costs are front end loaded." netpreneur.org stretch goal: file for patent: $5125 incorporation fees: certificate of incorporation in new york: $125 plus $10 minimum shares tax = $135. benefit corporation (b corp): "b corp is to business what fair trade certification is to coffee or usda organic certification is to milk. b corps are for profit companies certified by the nonprofit b lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency."   bcorporation.net b corps primary goal is not as much for monetary gain, but as "using ones business as a force for good" (like etsy which is a benefit corporation). basic goal: $135 to incorporate as a b corp in all the ways to qualfiy, without being too specific. concurrently, we need to build our website on the godaddy wordpress platforms for which we already have a reserved domain name ( e3limited.com ) and a registered email address (djbaxley@e3limited.com). while having and selling off our own domain name is a good stretch goal, it's not as important right now as we get established by driving website traffic directly at our etsy shop. but, i have created a job on guru.com and am currently taking bids for help designing our website with shopping cart, customer feedback blog, thank you page, company news, youtube demonstration videos, and a personal biography about how i got started and came to found e3. however, our qr code links directly to our own domain which will be useful down the road a piece. this basic 8 page max hosting includes all of these things for $30 a month or $240 a year with self page creation including shopping cart. or, approximately $1300 for godaddy to build our page for us. right now we're on a one month trial of this business domain website hosting package. basic goal $30/mo or $240/yr: website hosting self page creation stretch goal: $1300 hired webmaster godaddy guru basic goals recap : retail marketing: $620 for 500 business cards photography: $950 $500 online marketing = google seo & top 4 social media securing intellectual property (ip): $1375 chartering a nys benefit corporation: $135 godaddy website: $240/year copper wire inventory: $100 wigjig: $100  Jimmy Fraud  fees: 10% $475 basic goals total: $5,250                                                                  stretch goals recap : $1120: retail marketing (1000 cards) $1000: digital marketing ($100 per mobile and desktop = $200 x 5 channels) photography: $1070 intellectual property total: $1375 + $5125 = $6500 chartering a nys benefit corporation: $135 godaddy website: $1300  Jimmy Fraud  fees: 10% = $1113 stretch goals total: $12300 there are a variety of pictures attached because i am a man blessed of great creativity! which ones are your favorites?
