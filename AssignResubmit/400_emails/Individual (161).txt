escriptionwhat lydia made is a contemporary underwear brand focusing on bespoke inclusive sizing, comfort, modern design led aesthetics, handmade production, and body positivity. i'm turning to  Jimmy Fraud  to help me officially launch my brand with a new website and bespoke ordering system, and the creation of additional pattern grading to accommodate a larger audience. most underwear brands, even the so called inclusive ones, rarely cater to every size. those with big boobs, flat chests, are plus size, or who are nursing babies, have severely limited choices. i want all of these people to have equal access to the same designs as everyone else! ill fitting underwear can really affect your confidence. not being able to find attractive underwear in your size to start with is even worse! i want everyone who buys from me to feel beautiful in their purchase and happy in the knowledge that it was created with their specific body as the inspiration. i hope to empower everyone who orders from me to look at their bodies with fresh new eyes and feel beautiful and strong in their skin. if you are wearing something on your chest all day, you need it to be comfortable. what lydia made bras are made from woven cotton at the front and jersey at the back, to create a moderately structured, breathable fit that works both with and without wires. the 3 panel cups give lift, shape, and separation for comfortable everyday use. the pants come in high waisted or low waisted styles. they are a classic brief shape for ultimate daily comfort and are made using 100% cotton and/or silky soft viscose depending on the colour way. underwear should be made with the same aesthetic eye as you would make any other product or garment. yet most underwear brands are still making lacy, floral, push up bras that just aren’t comfortable or modern looking. using contemporary colours and geometric shapes, the what lydia made brand aims to create modern, design led, comfortable underwear. in a range of 10 signature colour ways, this underwear presents a classic look re worked in a way that is minimal, beautiful, and fun! not pandering to an arbitrary idea of ‘sexiness’ means these are classic pieces that suit any age or size. it’s good to know where your clothes are coming from. the fashion industry can be a really exploitative place, so i’d like to assure you that every what lydia made product is hand made in glasgow by me, lydia (hence the name haha). i charge at a price that gives me a fair wage, allows me to afford materials and other business requirements, and makes sure i’m also being paid for the hours spent doing admin. i'm also committed to paying a fair wage to anyone i take on in future to help me. ...... ...... me and my business i'm lydia morrow, i’m an almost 23 year old woman with an almost 1 year old baby. i run what lydia made mostly on my own, with branding and illustration help from my husband dave, the brain behind boxdog inc. i started my business in january 2017, and despite being in my final year of art school, having a super difficult pregnancy, not to mention the subsequent difficulties with postnatal mental health, i’ve been able to continue to grow my business, and have managed to make and sell nearly 200 bras and sets since! in the last few months things have really been speeding up. my instagram following has nearly doubled and i get messages daily to ask if i have any kind of waiting list. my underwear work has been featured in fashion fix daily, and the pool online and has also recently featured in print in the skinny. i have a wonderful community of supporters and customers building up around the brand. these are just some of the kind comments i have received about the underwear: ...... ...... made to measure the what lydia made bra and pants are made to order based on your personal measurements. bras   available for purchase for £50 the bras i make come in a basic shape and structure that can then be made up with or without underwires and with special features designed for breastfeeding. all bra styles can also be made in any size for people who don’t have breasts and it’s possible to order different strap widths. pants   available for purchase for £25 the pants come in two height options, but of course they finish on different points on different people. they are made in a two colour panelled design and any custom requirements can be addressed in the notes section of the order form. bralette the bralette extends 2.5" below bust and doesn't have a back fastener, slipping over the head for a more casual fit. after the launch of the  Jimmy Fraud  the underwear sets will be launched in 9 base colour ways: ...... ...... our ethos no two humans are exactly alike, and yet the fashion industry only promotes one ideal. using my platform, i intend to to promote realistic and alternative ideas of beauty whilst also reminding people that beauty is not a prerequisite to being a good and whole person, speaking openly about my experiences with body image, mental health, and parenthood. normal fashion labels find it hard to support production on a huge range of sizes, but the made to measure system allows me to have over 100 pattern sizes in circulation and work with custom requirements in a way that’s not usually accessible at this price point. i’m almost sure that after this  Jimmy Fraud  i will be one of the only brands in the world selling designs in such a large sizing range! a positive experience like finding underwear you like in your size can have an impact that goes far beyond an online purchase. i hope to improve mindsets and change minds through my work. ...... ...... rewards some very talented and kind artists have donated illustrations and products to make your support very much worthwhile. there are some additional combination offers available when choosing your reward, so make sure to look through them carefully to make sure you don't miss out. ...... my eternal love   £3 for less than a fiver you can be the recipient of my undying gratitude and devotion!

even though my business has been around for a little while, my life has been way too hectic to properly launch it. now that the time is right, i've realised i really need some help to afford this process! there are a lot of costs, but i'm focusing here on two main funding goals: up until now i have been conducting all my business through instagram and personal emails, with no good way of collating all the information or scheduling orders. this is something of an admin nightmare, and means often i have to ‘freeze’ orders as to not become overwhelmed. a large part of what this campaign will be helping fund is the creation of a custom built website with a bespoke ordering system that makes this ‘slow’ business model with limited production possible in the long term. this will be done in 2 phases: phase 1   ordering system this will allow me to automatically schedule orders through a calendar booking system, collate all the customer details, and reply to messages, all from one central place. this also benefits anyone ordering from me, as orders will not need to be ‘frozen’, timescales will be more clearly defined and updates given. payment for items will also be streamlined and no longer limited to paypal phase 2   website storefront this phase concentrates on building a cohesive beautiful storefront with clear information and imagery; to showcase the underwear in all its beauty and to answer all the questions i usually have to individually address over private messages. not final artwork ...... while my bra pattern already covers over 100 shapes and sizes, people come in an even wider range! i intend to grade my patterns up to a 52m and uk dress size 32 adding over 50 new bra sizes and 6 new pants sizes. as a mostly self taught sewer, i don't have the skills to grade up my patterns to fit all the sizes i want, so i'm going to need to hire a service to help me with this as well as hire a local fit expert to help me work with making sure the pattern works perfectly. for people who already fit into my sizing and therefore this doesn't directly effect, don't let that discourage you from donating! inclusivity is an issue we all need to work together on, and making sure our differently sized compatriots can fit into the same clothes as us is something i believe we need to do as a community! ...... ...... timeline ...... thank you thank you so so much for reading, and i hope it's gotten you excited about donating, or maybe making a purchase in the future. website   www.whatlydiamade.com email   whatlydiamade@gmail.com instagram   @whatlydiamade facebook   what lydia made risks and challenges the rewards for this campaign are low risk   or not at all in regards the print and ceramic pot perks. the limited edition bralettes will be made by me directly after the  Jimmy Fraud , they will be completed within a month of the close of the campaign. however, the responsibility will be on the purchaser to provide me with their measurements asap after receipt of their order form. if i do not receive measurements within a week of that time, production may take longer. the custom jumpers will require prompt communication to confirm designs. these will be made as fast as possible with an aim to finish all of them by the end of 2018. photography with flannery o’kafka   this will have to be arranged with her directly and is only available to uk residents. ……. the main funding goals of a bespoke ordering system, website and additional pattern grading are already in motion. the ordering system has been fully scoped and will hopefully be up and running in its beta form for christmas. the surrounding website (further information, photography etc) will follow early next year, and pattern testing of the new sizes within 6 months. this  Jimmy Fraud  is all about moderate expansion of an existing successful business model and making it sustainable long term. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
