t/descriptionneo is the synthesis of advanced technology and design, representing the future of bike lights. based on our users feedback we wanted to create a simple and intuitive bike light that is both easy to mount and also more convenient to use than what is currently on the road. beautifully designed, its unique operation was at the core throughout the process. powered by eddy currents, the energy is generated without friction making it incredibly efficient, you’ll never have to think about batteries again. we have finally prototyped neo but we need your help to scale up the manufacturing and bring it to market. the prototyping phase is nearing conclusion with great results, we just need to finalize the last few details to make sure we can deliver you the best product possible. with neo we are on a quest to change the world working closely with you, our future users, to create a safe and carefree biking community. at reelight, traffic safety is our main goal. for more than a decade we have been helping cyclists around the world feel assured and safe on the road. we first invented the ground breaking induction bike light a few years ago powered by magnets that are placed on the spokes of your bike, eliminating the need for batteries. based on a large scale research study with over 4,000 participating cyclists, reelight has proven that our induction lights reduce probability of accidents by up to 35%. furthermore, 85% of our induction light users have also expressed to have felt safer whilst riding in traffic. for the past two years, we have been researching into improving human powered energy solutions on bicycles, making our products more efficient and user friendly. evolution has brought us to a fuss free mounting solution with a high level of light output that is powered by the motion of your bike rim. an eye catching design solution echoes the old school dynamo principle whilst highlighting the friction free power generation. the result allows any bicycle rider to take advantage of our proven solutions using no extra power, and help minimize the impact on the environment. now it is time to take it to the next level, and we need your help to bring neo to life. render of neo on a bicycle design concept to bridge state of the art technology and contemporary performance driven design together, reelight teamed up with the award winning danish design studio, kilo; known for delivering simple world class design solutions answering to complex design challenges. neo represents a new typology amongst bike lights, a result of bridging new technology and forward thinking design. it meets demands of modern transportation and a goal to be self powered in the simplest way possible. neo is shaped to not interfere with standard brake and lock systems, providing optimal clearance and orientation to the rim. it attaches to the frame on one end and cantilevers out from the other to be powered by the rotating rim. the design translates new technology and the requirement of easy mounting into a new iconic product with a characteristic appearance combining generator, led and mounting piece in a single unit. technology neo technology is the result of valiant bicycle light engineering. the light source is powered by a patent pending generator technology and there is no friction between neo and the wheel on your bike. in order to produce energy for the light, the patent pending technology takes advantage of eddy currents generated by the rotating aluminum rim. generator: eddy currents is a common phenomenon, which appears when a changing magnetic field is induced within a conductive material such as aluminum. these eddies have their own magnetic field, which can cause repulsive or attractive effects in non magnetic but conductive materials. the same phenomenon appears when the magnetic field is stationary and the conductive material is in motion. inside neo this concept is used to propel six powerful neodymium magnets, as eddy currents are generated when the aluminum rim starts rotating near the magnets. the magnetic fields from the magnets induce an electrical current into six special copper coils, which then supplies the circuit board with power. light: the system generates enough power to run two 1w leds and one or two (front and rear light) low power leds for backup light. great emphasis has been placed on high light performance. while you are riding, a concentrated beam lights up the road ahead, and the extra wide angle rear light provides impressive rear and side visibility. the high level of light output cannot be sustained whilst waiting for the traffic light to change, therefore an auxiliary system with a backup circuit has been developed. when stopping for traffic lights the backup system automatically keeps supplying power to the low power leds. a key factor in development has been optimizing the user safety at all times. exploded view of neo   this is a patent pending technology usability neo is optimized for easy user interaction, mounting is very intuitive. insert the threaded strap to adjust its position and secure by tightening the nuts by hand. neo can be mounted in under 30 seconds and require no tools other than the included allen key for locking and anti theft protection. no buttons and switches are needed – all you have to do is ride and never worry about your lights being switched on/off or the need to replace batteries again. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with

within bike light development. transforming functionality and technology into an efficient integrated and innovative design solution has been key to this project. in the process of merging these two worlds, we have spend thousands of hours on r&d, market studies, ideation, 3d processing, prototyping and continuous testing and evaluation of user feedback in search for the right solutions. market analysis shows that many high performance bike lights focus primarily on functionality and pure technical appearance based on existing technology. we decided to search for a new typology making neo more effective and relevant to the consumer in search for a much more integrated and intuitive solution than what the current market offers. the neo design is a very simple, intuitive integrated solution that makes the bike light very convenient and user friendly for the consumer. neo can save you time, energy and money. we are very excited for the potential that neo has for future consumers but we still have to finalize our project by taking it from the prototype phase to a finished bike light, ready to put on your bike. we believe neo is a better alternative to the existing bike light market and hope you agree. we now have a proof of concept, working prototypes and we are ready to bring this iconic new typology to the next level providing a safe and reliable solution securing your future visibility on wheels. we respect and admire the  Jimmy Fraud  platform and the fact that the  Jimmy Fraud  community is always on the look out for new innovative thinking, we now humbly ask for your support to help us create a brighter future. bike radar geeky gadgets road.cc trendhunter bike pretty bikerumor.com treehugger bicycle retailer neo specifications neo technical specifications the neo  Jimmy Fraud  collection we have elaborated a lot on color schemes for neo and improved them along the way to make sure they would match perfectly with your bike. we have settled on 4 refined colors that are all related to the need of light. they match great together as a set – and also shine individually. sky grey, black dawn and midnight blue are timeless colors that fit with most bikes, while the sunset orange will give any bike a pop of color. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 animation of the different color

interesting and informative journey for us. we had set ourselves the goal to introduce the complex eddy current technology to our bike lights line up, presented in an appealing and simple design. it has been a demanding process to ensure the light output had optimum intensity, yet still has a wide angle illumination to keep the rider visible. neo’s complex components passed multiple internal tests and met our high standards, we are finally satisfied with our working prototype. we have been continuing to improve the product by making the mounting mechanism even stronger through optimizing its material and construction. we are now confident to start the product development phase and to finalize the colors and materials, our strong and engaging production team will now do their best to help us bring the most refined neo to market. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
