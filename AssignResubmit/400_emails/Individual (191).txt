now available   story and location                                                                    hello. thank you for taking the time to come and have a look at the  Jimmy Fraud  page for the new short film "the rite of rosemary". “there is a manhunt in the town of gaunts; a woman lies dead in harrow woods with a very unusual wound and a dangerous man is on the loose. jack hasn’t seen his eccentric father in over 25 years, but when he is forced to return to the quaint little town where he was raised, the two are reunited and the secrets both have been holding onto for so long are finally revealed.” when i originally read sarah scanlan's original short story "dead wood", i was instantly captivated with its dark themes, haunting images and fascinating characters. more so than anything though, i was drawn into its central story   a fascinating look into a reunion between father and son that takes the story on an unexpected journey full of twists and turns. i asked the author to allow me to adapt it into a short film, because i could see the potential, and i wanted to be able to visually share this story with everyone else too. at its heart, it is a human story about family ties, love and the consequences that come with the difficulties in life and achieving those. the film will very much be a psychological thriller genre, with filmic influences coming from "insomnia" by christopher nolan, the hbo show "true detective" and the recent "prisoners" by denis villeneuve. it will be a fascinating film visually, set in the heart of the deep countryside   which i believe to be a welcome change from the confined and busy feel of the city, as is present in many short films. the powerful acting, amazing and unique location,cinematography, sound design and haunting soundtrack will all come together to create a mood scape for the film that is both terrifying, intriguing and captivating. the narrative allows us to create a story free of cliches with surprises around every corner. to find out more about the film please check out our official website: http://riteofrosemary.co.uk   and to gain access to the backers only blog, please donate today! the cast bill thomas as thomas, the father bill thomas we are extremely lucky to have bill thomas on board playing the father. bill ranks amongst the most prolific character actors of his generation with over 450 roles on stage, films, television and commercials in his first 40 years so far within the industry. bill's audition blew us all away when he came in. it was an explosive, unpredictable and shocking readthrough that took the words off the page and made them come to life in a way that perfectly encapsulated the nature of the father. we can't wait to work with him. his heart remains in small scale inventive independent productions. numerous short films and long films, often thrilling and sometimes not, have filled the gaps in his schedule for the last few years, as he seeks adventure more than money now the kids have grown up. he came on board for the love of the script and story, and getting to focus on an interesting and extremely flawed character. bill will be known for various roles on television, such as tom henshall in the four seasons of the bbc series "cutting it" and three seasons as charles vance in the classic bbc serial "the house of elliot". he had the lead role in the award winning feature film "the sky in bloom" which has it's dvd release in february. other recent cinema release include "song of marion" with terence stamp and the remake of "pusher" a feature film with vertigo films. he is currently filming the film adaptation of tom mccarthy's extraordinary novel "remainder". his recent tv work has included a spell in "emmerdale" and episodes of "merlin", "atlantis" and "da vinci's demons". he got to drive a real train in "the great train robbery" last year. as well as this, a generation of young adults will know him as mr tucknott the pompous and long suffering bank manager in the classic "bodger and badger" series on bbc tv. guy barnes as jack, the son guy barnes for the role of jack, the son of thomas   we needed an actor that could convey an interesting journey in character development in a short space of time   without feeling forced or narratively confusing. it was a very difficult and sought after role to cast, but guy's audition stood over the crowd, as he nailed the script, and his chemistry with bill lit the room on fire when he came in. not only this, but his enthusiasm and dedication to the project is exciting and infectious to everybody else involved. guy barnes is an extraordinary actor who has recently completed filming lead roles in several short independent films including "no cover" in which he not only played the lead but also wrote, produced and performed the soundtrack ashes in a fire. he also has just wrapped on his first lead role in a feature film playing vampire jeremiah winterford in the forthcoming comedy horror feature film "rock band vs vampires". tanya page as constable merrifield tanya page tanya page will be playing be the small yet vital role of constable merrifield. tanya originally trained at lamda. her most recent credits include the short films "the memory man", "shoes, "it's time" and the feature film "invalid debris". she has played the role of mollie in the west end’s longest running play "the mousetrap", toured the length and breadth of the uk with "an ideal husband" and appeared on the bbc series "eastenders". why this short film? we have an incredible filmmaking team already on board, with an enormous amount of experience between us. along with the cast, everyone has agreed to come onto the short film from the strength of the script and wanting to tell the story in the best way possible for you as an audience. everyone that has read it, always agrees that it is an incredibly engrossing story with a real ride from beginning to the end   one that would translate perfectly to a visual medium. rather than just being a stepping stone onto bigger projects, the cast and crew believe that this is a piece of work that they will be proud to have a credit for and put into their portfolio. a short film comes with its own set of challenges as opposed to television or a feature film, condensing narrative and being able to tell a smaller story that doesn't feel lacking in any way as opposed to a larger one. we can genuinely see it making a large impression on the festival circuit and eventually come to on demand services, and hopefully more. where will the budget go? location costs and expenses. food and shelter for the cast and crew. props and art direction. set design. insurance. travel expenses. festival circuit fees. how can you help? it is an exciting project for everyone, which is why we would love you to help us   and make this story become a reality for both you, and for the cast and crew. by donating to the film, it will make you part of the team, and in return we will reward you for the contribution you have made to us. by opening up the filmmaking process, which is often seen as a hard to get to endeavor   we want to share the whole process with you, from casting to storyboarding to shooting to finishing. we truly believe that filmmaking is a collaboration, and an immensely exciting one at that. so, to fulfill my promise, i will be running a full time blog about the making of the film. full of insight, videos, interviews, clips, early access to footage, and more. sounds good, right? if you donate to the film, you'll become part of the rite of rosemary club and be given exclusive access to this blog. we have a wide range of perks available but with some truly fantastic rewards. there really is something for everyone: from production blog entry to signed collectors items through to vip access and full imdb credit. we're also promoting some fantastic "filmmaking" perks with access to writing, editing, sound and camera services for your own project   in return for you contributing to ours. if you have any further questions regarding this, please feel free to get in touch. though the cast and crew are all doing this project for the sheer love of the story, filmmaking unfortunately still requires a budget to make the process run smoothly and make the film possible. by reaching out to you as a community, it becomes possible to make this come to life. even the smallest contribution will make a difference   so please don't feel that you can only afford a small amount, so it's not "worth it". it is worth it. every single person that gives to the project will be supporting it in some way, big or small   the difference is, what rewards would you like to get in return? even if you cannot donate, please spread word to the larger world for us. share the project, tweet about the project, tell all your friends about the project. you will still be helping! the more people that know about us, help spread the word even more and like wildfire the project will begin to gain a community of followers behind it. if you help us, we can help you in return. get in touch if you want us to promote something for you, and we'll see what we can do to help! for more information on the film so far, please check out our social sites: www.facebook.com/riteofrosemary

for, but some are never predicted in the slightest. for this, the greatest potential obstacle to overcome is location. due to its nature of being set in the countryside, it rips away the safety blanket of the city   and the easy access to everything and all resources when we need them. along with this, the other main challenges will be exterior shooting in the woods and night shoots   because the british weather is as unpredictable as they come. these both provide an enormous amount of pressure on everyone, but we intend to use that pressure to push harder than we normally would and make sure that the sequence is completed on time, in budget and to a high degree too. with careful planning and contingency plans, all of these problems can be dealt with and avoided, and therefore won't become a major problem for the course of our three day shoot. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
