scriptionif we close the campaign with 120 backers or more having chosen a physical reward , "the mountains of madness" will be added to all complete sets of postcards, art prints, posters and fineart prints for free! in addition, if we go beyond that goal, we will be happy to bring "imprisoned with the pharaohs" to life and make it possible for you to add this amazing illustration to your collection by choosing it as an add on in the post campaign manager! we know that there are a lot of undecided cultists, waiting for the perfect moment to join our circle. the moment is now! greetings fellow worshippers of gruesome cosmic horror and welcome to our  Jimmy Fraud  project! you may have already read some of lovecraft’s fantastic writings, maybe just a few or maybe even his complete fiction. even if not, you might have come across the name lovecraft or his most popular creation, the great old one cthulhu. when you take a closer look, you will find lovecraft and his fiction in many different areas of modern life. his works have been published and put together in numerous different anthologies, board games, video games, films and countless numbers of fictional writings have been influenced by his stories. so what is the point in our project? lovecraft’s stories, his desperate protagonists, his monstrous creatures and unnamable gods have led to a huge number of paintings and illustrations! we thought even though many artworks are published, there is still something missing. therefore, we made up our minds asking ourselves what we find most impressing in lovecraft’s fiction. then we concluded… it is the unique atmosphere of the places that lovecraft takes us to in his magnificent writings. he takes us to places no one has ever been, places of pure darkness and mind disturbing cosmic power, places that make us feel uncomfortable and weak…places of the unease! visit these places together with us, pictured in these wonderful and unique illustrations! full moon above the mystical devil reef the shadow over innsmouth (november–december 1931): the story: on his tour past new england, the protagonist arrives at the seaport of innsmouth. not only the shady building and the smell of the old port are odd, but also the people living there seem strange in many ways. there are only a handful of people the protagonist gets to know that seem to be normal. among them is an elderly local named zadok allen, who is always good for a drink and willing to share is wondrous stories with everyone who is willing to listen. nevertheless, what old zadok allen is telling, is more than freighting and at the end, the protagonist reveals a very personal dark secret. the illustration: innsmouth has been illustrated many times but mostly the view chosen was more or less comparable. we wanted to show a different perspective. that is why we choose to look from the harbor on to the dark and mystical devil reef from where all the horrifying events emerge and where the events find their disturbing end. the steep stairs up the rue d'auseil the music of erich zann (december 1921) the music of erich zann is presumably set in paris, although there is no actual reference to the city. the story is about a student that is searching for an affordable room to rent. he finds a room in an old, nearly empty building on the rue d'auseil. one of his few neighbors is a musician called erich zann, who is playing the viol in a local theatre orchestra. the student can hear erich zann playing from his room, and soon he recognizes that the melodies the old man is playing are different to everything he has ever heard before. these melodies seem out of this world, as well as the cosmic horror zann can see from his window high above the rue d'auseil. the illustration: the rue d'auseil, with its steep stair, the old houses and the high wall at its end, which keeps the dark secrets of this story away from the viewer, made the greatest impression on us. lovecraft put this place in the spotlight, right from the beginning of the story. following the footsteps of student up to the third house counted from the upper end of the street, was the intention for this illustration. deep in the dark forests of vermont the whisperer in darkness (february–september 1930) the story: albert n. wilmarth, an instructor for literature at the miscatonic university receives a letter from henry wentworth akeley, who is living in an old farmhouse in vermont. in his letters, akeley describes hearing strange noises of extra terrestrial beings wandering around the farmhouse, leaving behind traceable footprints that seem not to belong to any animal known. the threat that akeley describes gets more and more intense and opposite to his prior letters, akeley orders wilmarth to come to his place. wilmarth agrees and makes his way up to vermont. the illustration: when we follow wilmarths way up to vermont, along abandoned roads that lead to even more abandoned, muddy trials deeper and deeper into the vast wilderness of the mountains, we reach the akeley farm. bringing together the dark and dilapidated view of the old farmhouse with the mysterious light coming from its cellar and the plateau in the mountains with the standing stone meant putting all essentials into one picture. haven’t noticed the chanting men and extra terrestrial beings in the background? …take a closer look, if you dare! deceptive glow in the depths the temple (1920) the story: in “the temple”, we follow the voyage of the german u boat led by lieutenant commander graf von altberg ehrenstein. after sinking a british freighter in the north atlantic, the crew discovers a strange ivory figurine among the belongings of a dead seaman. in the following days more and more strange things happen including the crew reporting having seen the dead seaman outside the u boats portholes. the tension is rising among the crew and upon the encounter with an u.s. warship; altberg shoots several crewmembers who urge him to surrender. altberg commands the u boat to submerge and continue its way deeper and deeper into the ocean. at last altberg is the only living being left and he prepares to leave the u boat to explore a mysterious temple that the found at the bottom of the after all systems and crewmembers have died. the illustration: we wanted to have both perspectives to be presented in the illustration, which is why we decided not to go for the view through the portholes of the u boat to show altberg's view at the temple. as we found that both elements are very important for the story, we wanted to have them represented equally. the dark blue sea delivers the perfect background to maximize the effect of the mysterious light emerging from the temple door…somehow magnetic, isn’t it? freezing dread on west fourteenth street cool air (march 1926) the story: in cool air, the protagonist tells the story of how he became extremely sensitive to cool air. he lives in an apartment in an old brownstone house in new york. one day he discovers chemical stains on his floor, which seem to result from a leakage somewhere in the apartment above him. searching for the cause of the leakage, he gets to know dr. muñoz, an old physician. the doctor’s room is kept cold by ammonia based refrigeration system. someday the pump driving the system break down and the doctor‘s health declines rapidly. at this time, the protagonist experiences that dr. muñoz has a dark secret that he kept for very long time. the illustration: displaying a typical view on a new york street of the 1920s to 1930s with its typical brownstone houses was the basis for this picture. in addition, we wanted to allow the viewer to see the silhouette of dr. muñoz in one of the windows. the whole scenery should have a very cold and frosty atmosphere, especially close to the window where the cool air is covering everything with ice. darkness rising upon federal hill the haunter of the dark (march 1937) the story: the haunter of the dark is the last story that lovecraft wrote before he died in 1937. robert blake, an author with a high interest in the occult watches the old church on federal hill from his window. blake is getting more and more fascinated by the sinister building and its dark history. especially the stories about a cult called the church of the starry wisdom catch his attention. one day blake decides to go up on federal hill und enter the abandoned church, finding much more than he has hoped for. the illustration: the element of darkness is a key aspect of the story and we definitely wanted to have that shown in the artwork. dark and unpleasant elements dominate the scene while there a only a few lights included. but the central aspect of the scene is of course the tower with the portentous light of the trapezohedron and the haunter lurking from the tower wall. ancient secrets beyond the cyclopedic mountains at the mountains of madness (february, march, april 1936) if we close the campaign with 120 backers or more having chosen a physical reward, we will automatically add “the mountains of madness” to every set! dark rituals in the gloomy shadow of the pyramids (preview sketch) imprisoned with the pharaohs (february 1924) if we close the campaign with 160 backers or more having chosen a physical reward, this artwork will be available as an add on to your collection! who might be most likely the best illustrator for a job like this? you’re right! someone who’s personal preference is to paint dark and mysterious places and scenes! so we instantly had a connection, when we approached nele with our thoughts and ideas. nele diel is a fulltime freelance illustrator from wiesbaden, germany. she started her carrier after finishing university, working in the entertainment industry for several years now. her main focus is on environments, landscapes and scenes, which was the perfect match for us. you might have already noticed some of neles illustrations for card games like hex: shards of fate, lord of the rings, arkham horror, legend of the five rings and many more. there’s even some work related to the lovecraft universe to be found in the new version of machina archana, in arkham horror and eldritch horror. as you can see, it was pretty obvious that we team up with nele to bring this amazing project to life. here is a glimpse on how nele works in order bring these sinister sceneries to life: you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 just a few words about us in general, as there are more interesting stories to tell (laugh). we are a bunch of lovecraft enthusiasts located in the cologne area in germany. lovecraft’s works inspired us in various ways, leading to numerous board game and rpg sessions, film and book discussions, visiting all kind of conventions and finally yet importantly to team up with nele diel in order to bring some of lovecraft’s most impressing stories to live through very detailed and atmospheric illustrations. we are committed to deliver high quality for every product we are offering in this campaign. so we chose reliable manufacturers to ensure that you will be satisfied with what you get from us. for those you are devoted enough to choose the “true art devotee” or the “pickmans follower” tier, we will take the quality to the highest level possible! this kind of quality level requires a real printing expert and over the top printing products. therefore we chose the german manufacturer hahnemühle to provide the premium paper quality for the limited art prints. our paper of choice: hahnemühle "william turner" hahnemühle fineart paper type "william turner" hahnemühle says: "with its matt watercolour texture this paper is a genuine mould made paper in both look and feel. william turner is ideal for reproductions of traditional artworks and also for striking and expressive photo reproductions." we want you to be sure, that you are getting something very special and unique by choosing our limitied fineart prints! searching for a proper way to sign and number these prints we discovered a very sophisticated solution: epson says: "digigraphie® denotes a printout on a professional epson stylus pro printer with ultrachrome™ k3 vivid magenta inks on certified paper. each print is signed by the artist / copyright holder with number and signature and equipped by us as digigraphie® specialist laboratory with a certificate. each print within the edition thus becomes an unmistakable original." here is what you've been waiting for while going through all the information we presented. please note the following photos have been taken of the original products, colours might differ due to lighting, screen settings and other reasons! postcards the mad mailman you will receive a set of 2 x 6 high quality postcards showing all six wonderful illustrations in their original look. so you will have one set to send out to your fellow cultist and one to keep for yourself! the mailman’s memories you like the “good old days” better?
