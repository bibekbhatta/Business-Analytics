ho are we? we are a collective who believes that creative collaboration is the strongest asset in the art and business of filmmaking. our philosophy celebrates the idea that, by harnessing the voices and talents of many, movies & television are the most democratic & wide reaching art form of our time. with this in mind, we have gathered together six unique production teams that will be creating six different short films, each exploring a different aspect of love, together in one anthology. the six teams each consist of one writer/director, one producer, and two actors, and in the spirit of collaboration, the teams will be helping one another out with different aspects of their production process. where do you fit in? the final key to the filmmaking process is audience support. it is for you that we strive to make art that matters, which touches people, and brings them together to consider questions about why we are here and what it means to human. for all these reasons, we have created this  Jimmy Fraud  campaign to unite our audience members with the filmmakers, and involve them in the entire production process from start to finish. please consider becoming a part of our team and investing in the future of young filmmakers, who want the support of their audience as they realize and share their vision with the world! thanks to your support, we've already reached our minimum  Jimmy Fraud  goal of $6,000! we can't thank you enough! but, this is just the amount of funding it will take to record our stories at a minimal production value. how will the additional funding be utilized? surpassing a stretch goal of $18,000 will allow us properly pay our fantastic crews, gain the legal permits necessary for shooting safely on location, and afford higher quality cameras & equipment rentals for a better looking final film. achieving our ultimate stretch goal of $30,000 will allow all six films to create the most professional level product possible, and reach the widest audience. the additional funds will allow us to cover the cost of some absolutely incredible practical and special effects, afford top of the line cameras & equipment, and enhance the overall look and feel of each short film by utilizing the very best resources that the film & television industry has to offer. but, before we ask for you to invest in the success of our project, we'd

film calls for different budget requirements in different areas, but we all must evenly share whatever budget we end up with. that means, in order to give you the best film anthology possible, our team of 6 producers must utilize the budget and work together in a completely transparent and cohesive way, in addition to going above and beyond their expected duties to their individual teams. the producers will be pulling all the strings that we possibly can in pre production, assisting all of the other teams on set during principal photography, and operate as creatively as possible in post production to ensure that we take the budget you give us and stretch it as far as it can go. we need your help to make these stories of love come to life! learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
