wristwatch whose design is based on the pieces worn by us and european military men in the middle of the 20th century. sherman watch the idea behind our project is obvious at the first look but challenging nevertheless. the look and distinctive features became iconic after the war ended, and that’s what inspired us to research this phenomenon further and develop our own wristwatch which draws on the best and most interesting details, converting them into a modern, attractive and fresh shape. our goal was to create a military inspired wristwatch, but the most important thing was to make it stand out among other products. avenger watch we were dazzled by the design of us military watches, german b uhr, and british www class timepieces. our collection strives to reflect on all the iconic models, to rework and revive them. however, we needed to start simply. so we combined their most classic and appealing features into two models – sherman and avenger. stretch goal #2 ($60,000)

the avenger takes inspiration from two sources. first, the grace and strict functionality of wwii era military wristwatches. second, the aircraft dashboards of us and raf jets and airplanes, such as produced by lockheed, hawker and grumman. the model bears the name of the us heavy bomber grumman avenger. there are several crucial points we needed to emphasize in our watch to allow the spirit of the classic pilot watch to shine through. as a result, the dial offers precise time telling through a sleek, clean design with contrasting indexes, a rounded layout, and 24 hour markings. the seconds dial design is based on dashboard supportive indication elements of wwii bomber planes. in the center of the dial is a large triangle which was used for quick orientation while in the air during military campaigns. the outer layer indexes are volumetric and covered with a lume coating. this special coating is a reflection of indexes made of luminous material that were common on vintage watches of the wwii era. the strap is stylized as a kevlar fiber to strengthen the overall military look. the sherman watch offers boldness and rough power in its design. it draws inspiration from sherman, valiant and churchill tank instrument panels and also infantry timepieces of the mid 20th century. the dial offers a simplified layout with large, easily readable indexes on the hour layer and minute marks on the inner layer, granting accuracy necessary for your typical infantrymen. the differing layer finishings conceptualize the idea of the harsh varied environment which both infantry and tanks encountered. the seconds dial hand and other elements have a bold, massive structure resembling their source of inspiration. the lume coats the dial's applied volumetric digits and grants clear view even under challenging circumstances. the strap has texture and color similar to wwii flak jackets used by war machine pilots and drivers. military watches are a specific niche of watchmaking and watch culture. they have a grand history, clear and strict guidelines in a modern environment, and a lot of fans all over the world. we found the modern take on military timepieces currently available to be too gentle and shy, and there are too few projects that offer something really interesting in this area. that’s what served as a push for us in creating arma. sherman watch so we started historical research on this matter, looking for old photographs, information and preserved watches to examine. all this was to create a watch that maintains strict yet charming and well known design elements and make it appealing to the modern watch enthusiast. of course, you can always buy a vintage watch, but we strive to create something that is stripped of the flaws inherent in a single collectible, improves its features, offers up to date technological quality and will become a desirable vintage watch itself. avenger watch the conceptual idea behind arma watches is not to merely pay homage to classic military timepieces. but also to integrate it into the lifestyle of a modern citizen, as well as make it worthy of any watch collection. arma watches meet all criteria for a matching contemporary timepiece, both from technical and aesthetic points of view. preserving the military chronometers' features, we managed to cover it in a sleek, up to date design which will look at home on every wrist, thanks to its universality and conceptual variety. avenger watch but don’t think about us as of some kind of warmongering designers. arma is a totally anti war project in its beliefs. we cast aside the circumstances that led to creation of military watches and drew inspiration only from the aesthetics. our work is pure design and that helps us to inject our ideas into the modern look and lifestyle even easier, which results in one beautiful and stylish timepiece series that is an out of time accessory for everyone. sherman watch arma watches are not simply a design product. we want to achieve the highest standards of quality with our watches, making it as close in durability and reliability as possible to their sources of inspiration. the watches are made of high quality materials and geared with a reliable 17 jewel hand winding movement. the back lid is transparent and offers a perfect view of the work of the movement, erasing a dividing line between functionality and ergonomic design. we wanted to maintain a strict ergonomic look even in the color palette and style of the strap. one is a smooth khaki suede, and the other is black with a kevlar like structure. all straps are made of genuine cow skin by hand or from nylon and are strong and durable, which were tested by us before launching the campaign. the dial is another matter of exquisite attention to detail. each model offers different layer finishing and significant depth in dial design. all hour indexes are volume and applied by hand with a bright luminous coating, sticking to the original military watch design with convex digits made wholly of lume material. both second dials have a sunray texture. main dials have a rough grained surface as well, aiming to support a tough overall look for the watch. the development process turned out to be one of the most challenging parts of all. our goal was to reimagine the most iconic watches and their features in a contemporary fashion. we studied a lot of timepieces of the past, both in person and through images, consulted the watch community and collectors, learned a lot about watchmaking, as well as on historical aspects of the subject. all of this was done to create something that fits perfectly into the industry for modern military watches. we began by developing each part of the watch manually — creating, calculating and thoroughly choosing every detail from scratch. we don’t use pre made parts in our watches. every smallest detail was specifically created for the watch in order to complete an authentic look and make this timepiece a product desired by watch enthusiasts for years to come. another aspect we want to emphasize is movement. the technical side of the project is as vital for us as the design. we spent a lot of time choosing the proper movement mechanism to support our concept. while it was common for wwii era watches to sport simple in design yet reliable movements, we wanted to add something more elegant, beautiful and spectacular to the watch and make it more fashionable with a transparent back lid. that’s why we chose this movement — it offers a great look, is wound by hand, has proven to be reliable and precise, and helps us maintain an acceptable price. both models have a case made of lightweight 316l stainless steel with a matt finishing. the back lid is also made of steel, has a transparent glass embedded in it, offering a great view of the movement. the movement is a seagull ty 3620 with 17 jewels, and the watch construction grants 5 atm water resistance. each dial offers different layer finishings, gradating from a smooth to rough grained surface and sunray finishing on the seconds dial. case diameter: 44 mm case thickness: 12 mm band
