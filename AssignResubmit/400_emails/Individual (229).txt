premiering in 2010, journeyquest is a global, fan funded phenomenon. with the support of our passionate fanbase, we bring you a feature length third season! as the story continues, the search for an oracle brings our heroes to a dwarven mining town in which they are pursued by an assassin, orcs, glorion (their former fighter), and wren, a recently fired bardic historian. who are we? we are the team at zombie orpheus entertainment. since our inception in 2010, we've released award winning shows and films like the gamers: hands of fate , humans & households , natural 1 , dark dungeons , and most recently, the gamers: the series . and of course, two seasons of journeyquest ! with thousands of happy backers from prior  Jimmy Fraud  campaigns, we have a track record of quality, project completion, and kick ass storytelling. plus, as with our other shows, journeyquest season three will be released under a creative commons license , allowing fans everywhere to remix, share, and play in the world of the show. our production team executive producer/writer : matt vancil ( the gamers series, journeyquest ) producers : rennie araucto ( hands of fate ) and tony becerra ( journeyquest ) director : christian doyle ( dorkness rising, journeyquest ) director of photography : jeremy mackie ( journeyquest, hands of fate ) when will it shoot? thanks to the generous support of our core fans, writers matt vancil and kate marshall have already completed the script, which means that we can begin production in april 2016. the cast and crew are scheduled, locations are getting locked down, and we're ready to begin ramping up production as soon as this campaign succeeds. in order to continue the story, this campaign needs to raise a minimum of $420,000 before february 19th. if we reach that threshold, our backers will be charged and we'll get to make the show. if we do not, no money will exchange hands and the show will not be made. first and foremost, we have to build an epic fantasy world : locations, sets, costumes, props, makeup, prosthetics, set dressing. this season includes a dwarven mining town and tavern, the first appearance by ogres in the series, a secret mountain hideaway, and so much more. we also want to pay our cast and crew a living wage . film production is their career and we want to make sure their labor is compensated fairly. this production budget is the minimum that we need to do right by the story, the cast and crew, and the fans . with $0.77 out of every dollar going directly in the show and $0.12 going directly to creating and fulfilling the cool rewards that we've put together for you, this is going to be one of our most cost effective productions yet. tell me more about these rewards edit: read all about the new rewards right here. every reward is designed with our historical attention to quality and detail. first, every backer will receive access to our backerkit store , where you'll be able to find add ons and exclusives after the campaign, including dvds of prior seasons, digital downloads, and (if unlocked) exciting new merch at a deep discount. our digital downloads are always drm free, which means you can play, edit, and share them anywhere. and we'll deliver them in the highest possible quality. in addition to the download of the show itself, we'll also include a pdf of the nethadric's pranks adventure path , a ten part, 154 page journeyquest tabletop adventure module compatible with pathfinder and savage worlds. we've also heard fan feedback and are including our collectible embroidered patches with every physical order: no need to wait for the stretch goal on this campaign! at $100 and up, every backer will get to work directly with series creator matt vancil to coin a new orcish word . your contribution will become an official part of the orcish language and we'll commemorate it with an exclusive etched metal card (3.5 x 2 inch) that includes your name, your backer number, your word, and its definition. at $250, you'll attend our season three wrap party for a night with the cast and crew. we'll have a bag of unique memorabilia for you, photo opportunities, food, games, and a first look at raw footage from the set. and an exclusive perf miniature . you're responsible for your own transportation to seattle and lodging, so plan ahead on this one! at $500, you receive a much coveted red card , which allows you to flag bad puns, off color remarks, or other violations by our cast and crew, both from set and in person at conventions. we'll send that person to time out, sub in somebody new, and film and upload the results for you. and now you can bring your red card with you, with a dual color etched metal card (2.75 x 4.5 inch) that includes your name and backer number. plus, we'll give you an exclusive cast & crew t shirt . at $1000 and above, we've designed our rewards to be an incredible experience: you'll spend time with us on set or at the game table , have opportunities to appear in the series , receive exclusive art , and have your name featured in the credits and on imdb . plus, by popular request, at $2500 and above we're also including full size perf hats . as always, you will be responsible for your own lodging and transportation, as well as to arrive on set on the day we schedule you. so check your april calendars now! what if i already contributed?

if you contributed at www.fansupported.net , send us a message with your name and the email address you used. we will check our master spreadsheet and provide you with a statement. what about add ons? add ons will be available in backerkit after the campaign ends. please do not add any money to your pledge unless you a) are a prior contributor (as discussed directly above) or b) you are making an additional contribution to support the show. *****what about shipping?***** this is really important, so read carefully: we will charge for all shipping after the campaign in backerkit. in order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. do not add shipping fees to your pledge now. the short version— international backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in backerkit for base shipping on the $50 reward. domestic backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in backerkit for base shipping on the $50 reward. the long version, for people who like details— international backers: we are working with a third party agency to fulfill your orders from warehouses in europe, canada, and australia. this should help cut your typical u.s. shipping costs by a huge margin. however, please be aware that you may still be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero value item. duties will not be included in your shipping charge. domestic backers: we want to get the best possible shipping and handling rate for you. rather than over estimating expenses now, we will charge actual rates when we are ready to ship. all backers: by handling shipping this way, we reduce unknown costs now, which means we know exactly how much we can put into the production budget, and then we can use economy of scale to make specific shipping orders with exact details. what will shipping cost, you ask? international orders will average $.99 handling per item, plus local shipping costs . this should still be much less than you have paid in the past. (for example, in 2013 our cost to ship a dvd internationally began at $8.59 and went up from there as the weight increased.) unfortunately, we cannot calculate this more precisely until we know our volume and can negotiate for the best rate possible. domestic orders will start at the current media mail rate for a five ounce parcel, plus a minimum of $.25 handling per item. you can estimate that shipping will begin around $3.99, plus more for larger or heavier packages that include more than a dvd and patch. again, we'll use our volume to negotiate for the best possible quote. more ways to help thank you for supporting journeyquest season three! we're excited to make these new episodes, with your help and encouragement! beyond pledging (and even a single dollar helps!) you can help spread the word in the following ways: share this campaign and the video on social media. include a statement about why you love journeyquest. share the first two seasons . encourage people to appreciate what we've already made possible and help them turn into fans. create and share your own fan art. we love seeing the amazing things people have made based on journeyquest! write your personal journeyquest story. write a longer piece, or shoot a video, or tweet a haiku, about what journeyquest means to you. share it somewhere like medium.com. make it compelling, interesting, and fun. interact with the community. post and respond to comments here, or on facebook, or on youtube. get to know other fans. help show the world that we're not just a group of fan funders, but friends and collaborators in building a positive, inclusive, and welcoming community. risks and challenges every campaign has risks and challenges. this is a big, complex machine with the potential for all kinds of things to go wrong. a cast member could have to drop out and be replaced. a location could decide not to host us. with large film projects, these kinds of issues are inevitable. furthermore, we could face delays, large expenses, or terrible storms on shoot days. on top of that there's fulfillment and delivery, which could also get delayed. but there's also good news: we've overcome all of these challenges in the past. we shot through the hailstorm at chambers bay. we rewrote scenes to finish before losing the sun. and we've fulfilled our reward obligations through blood, tears, and long hours rolling thousands of signed posters into tubes. basically, we're professionals and we know how to deliver on our promises, how to communicate when we're behind, and how to email backers dozens of times to track down correct shipping addresses. yes, we have our share of screw ups—and if you're one of the half dozen backers from prior campaigns who never gave us shipping addresses, please help us help you receive your rewards!—but we'll make every effort to make it right when we do mess up. if you're new to the zoe family, we encourage you to check in with people who have backed us in the past. watch our shows. listen to our commentary tracks and relive the problems we've solved. through rain or shine, we'll get the job done and deliver another awesome show. thanks for your support! learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
