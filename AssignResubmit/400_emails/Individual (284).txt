nd a notable women in computing playing card deck featuring 54 notable women in computer science. give a deck to a cousin who's not sure if girls can be engineers. bring it to your poker night to make a point. learn more about the history and future of women in computer science. by becoming a backer, you help us bring the cost of producing these decks from $18/deck to $10/deck and ship decks to educators who can't afford them. this  Jimmy Fraud  is to fund a printing of the second edition. we're distributing the first edition at the grace hopper celebration of women in computing right now and want to incorporate our lessons learned in the second edition. here's some photos from when the first edition arrived: here is a complete list of the women included in the first edition . the honorees we have worked with have been entirely supportive of this project. though we've heard nothing but excitement from the women included, some may choose to withdraw before we print the second edition, so it may be a bit different. what we hope to do in the second edition. distribute dozens of decks to educators with projects in mind but no funding to buy decks. possibly switch vendors to one with higher quality paper. include updated photos of several of the honored women (we've already received some). correct any mistakes in the first edition. release a poster. here's the current version: who's behind this? professor susan h. rodger (professor of the practice, duke university), katy dickinson (vice president   mentoring, everwise), and jessica dickinson goodman collaborated on this project. duke university and everwise are project sponsors; without them, this project would not have been possible. this project is a labor of love for the women behind it, which is why we are licensing the card deck under creative commons attribution noncommercial sharealike 3.0 u.s. license. we have done a number of things to ensure this deck only helps, and does not hurt, women in computing. our efforts included: using public domain images, seeking individual permission for other images, working to represent the reality of diversity of women in computing, and including input on the project from women leaders in technology. if you have a concern (don’t like the public domain photo we found of you, don’t think the photo you took can be licensed in the way we did, decided you did not want to be included) we want to know and we will do our best to help you. please contact us with questions. what does "notable" mean? women in this card deck were selected after receiving multiple, high level awards from more than one institution, such as being named an acm fellow, ieee fellow, and receiving the turing award. our deck also seeks to portray the true diversity of women in computing both current and historical, showcasing professionals from a variety of nations, backgrounds, gender identities, orientations and abilities. there are a dozen or more different groupings of notable women we could have turned into this deck; you can make your own using the instructions at the bottom of this page. budget: $3,000 for 300 decks we will make $0 profit from this project. after self funding the first edition, we have a solid idea of how to print, distribute, and roll all profit back into this project to reach as many people as possible. here is a chart showing all of the major costs associated with printing the second edition. we're happy to answer any questions you have. 1st goal: $3,000 if we buy 300 decks, the printing, fulfillment, and shipping will cost $9.56/deck. we've decided to go with a competitively priced fulfillment service to ensure everyone gets their decks on time and in good condition. that $10 allows us to roll the $.44 in profit back in to pay for the decks we will be donating to schools and libraries who can't afford to buy decks, and any emergency costs in the project. 2nd goal: $7,000 if we buy 700 decks, the printing, fulfillment, and shipping will cost $8.81/deck. the same competitively priced fulfillment service to ensure everyone gets their decks on time and in good condition. that $10 allows us to roll the $1.19 in profit back in to pay for the decks we will be donating to schools and libraries who can't afford to buy decks, and any emergency costs in the project. 3rd goal: $10,000 if we buy 1,000 decks, the printing, fulfillment, and shipping will cost $8.26/deck. the same competitively priced fulfillment service to ensure everyone gets their decks on time and in good condition. that $10 allows us to roll the $1.74 in profit back in to pay for the decks we will be donating to schools and libraries who can't afford to buy decks, and any emergency costs in the project. timeline we'll be finalizing the second edition while this campaign is running, so if we make our goal we'll place the order as soon as the money lands in our account (up to 2 weeks from the end of the campaign). from then, the order should take 1 week to get to our fulfillment vendor, who will then ship the decks within a week. we're planning to ship usps first class, which takes 1   3 weeks domestically and internationally. worst case scenario, decks should be arriving mid december, in time for the holidays. history of this project this card deck is one part of a project that's been going on for years and involved a number of passionate volunteers. it is associated with the “cra w and anita borg institute wikipedia project – writing wikipedia pages for notable women in computing” work that katy dickinson (vice president   mentoring, everwise), professor susan h. rodger (professor of the practice, duke university), and others have worked on for years. learn more and get involved in that work here: bit.ly/notablew the idea for a card deck started during an annual camping trip in the high sierras. katy and jessica (mother and daughter) were discussing katy's joint research poster with susan. jessica suggested a card deck to highlight 54 of the women as a way to help other technical women interact with the stories of leaders in the profession. they spent hours designing some prototypes, and when susan saw and loved them, they decided this could be fun. katy wrote the text and tracked down the majority of the photos; susan reached out for permissions, gave feedback on design, and helped curate the list; and jessica combined all of the information into intuitively designed cards, handled the printing logistics, and product management. educators: request donated decks the women behind the notable women in computing playing card deck have heard from a number of teachers and librarians who have great ideas for projects, but can't afford to buy the decks they need at this point in their budget cycles. we're hoping some backers will choose the give 1/get 1 option and allow us to send bundles of decks to those who can use them. in anticipation of that, we're taking are requests from educators for donated decks with this form . it should take <15 mins to fill out. if we receive more requests for donated decks than we have decks, we prefer to donate decks to people/groups who are good at moving girls and women into technical careers and who can't pay for the decks they need. we also prefer people/groups with a specific use case, a demonstrated history of encouraging women in computer science, and who are willing to take a picture of the decks when they receive them (we send the pictures to backers). want another combination of rewards? do you have a middle school class of 19 children and want to buy decks for the class, plus a poster for the room and plus a poster for your office? ping us and we'll probably add a 19 + 2 posters award level. the entire idea of including posters came from a request, so if you have an idea of another way we could get the word out, let us know or you can do it yourself (see instructions for download at the bottom of the page). other ways to get involved go to bit.ly/notablew to find information about other notable women in computing, then commit to writing or editing a wikipedia page for a woman without one. here you'll find a list of 330+ incredible women , many of whom have little to no presence online. you can help fix that. if you got a first edition deck at the hopper conference, send us a picture! we'd love to post it as an update (mention @jessidg, @katy_dickinson, @shrodger, or the tag #notablew). if you have a ladies who tech poker night, send us a picture. we'd love to see our work in the wild. international shipping we're working on ways to bring down the costs of international shipping, but as of right now it looks like it would cost $30 using the u.s. postal service's first class service. we'll update as we know more, since we know that cost could be prohibitive for some potential backers. instructions for printing your own deck the notable women in computer science card deck is designed to help women working in the field and those who support them identify those who've gone before them. we want it to spread far and wide, which is why we are releasing everything you need to print a copy of the first edition on your own and licensing the entire project under creative commons attribution noncommercial sharealike 3.0 u.s. license . learn how to print them here (it will take about 45 minutes and $18 for one deck). risks and challenges we worked out a lot of the kinks with printing on the first edition, and are spending the next 2 weeks tracking down and finalizing a contract with a fulfillment vendor. we'll announce it once we have one, but our research shows that the costs of paying a professional third party is worth it to ensure decks go out to the world in good condition and get there in time. see the budget section for how all of the costs line up and feel free to ask questions  jessica's the lead on logistics, so you can reach out to her at @jessidg on twitter. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
