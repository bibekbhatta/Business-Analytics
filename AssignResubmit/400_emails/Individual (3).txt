(also, if you succeed this much we'll give $1 off every purchase at the bar for a month, for you and all of your friends you bring to the space.) we're confident that almost every show can bring in 10 audience members, but we're not just going to leave that all on you. we will help you build your audience: cross promotion: every show will be listed on our website, get support from our social media, and be included in programs which we'll hand out at every show. expert advice: we will also give you advice in effective marketing strategies for small scale shows. (spoiler: it's not posters) a built in audience: we will also be develop a devoted audience which comes to see shows simply because they are at the pocket. we want you to be amazing, and we will do whatever we can to help. as you build your audience the pocket will be a place where you can continue to grow. there will be three kinds of shows that will be in the space: one time only: a brand new show, a visiting artist, a press preview. try something out and see if it sticks. multi week runs: we will focus on giving shows which couldn't otherwise afford a long run. this will allow you to get press to actually attend your event. keystone shows: you can consistently fill a house, so we'll partner with you to put on shows on a regular basis. monthly, weekly. build a strong following. there's a clear path from one kind of show to the next. but hopefully you'll become too big for the pocket. in which case we'll connect you with other larger spaces in town, and help you get the best rental deal possible. why? because we like you! there are many reasons that the pocket will be an awesome place to see performances: the facilities awesome lobby: will have a fully functional bar which will accept major credit cards. it will be well lit, have drink specials, and be a comfortable place to hang out before and after shows. comfortable theater: the theater seats will be comfortable, and the theater itself will be as sound proof as possible. also, you will be able to see. guaranteed. no bad seat in the house. regular maintenance: it will be kept clean! special treatment (if the audience ain't happy, ain't nobody happy) reimbursed for service charges: if you pre order a ticket we'll give you $2 off your first drink at the bar to pay you back for your charges. loyalty programs: if you come to a bunch shows, you'll get free stuff. tickets, drinks, and exclusive shows. intimate experiences: because the theatre is so small we can work hard to make every individual's experience special. impact: you will help determine what shows we produce. we will regularly poll audiences, asking about what shows they enjoyed. you will matter. wonderful performances we don't just rent, we co produce: we will consciously program shows in the space so we maintain a consistently high quality of performance. unique shows: live recordings of pod casts, touring shows from out of town, collaborative shows between improv and stand up comedians, neo futurist esque showcases. you name it! we'll be giving interesting shows a home. connection to established communities: clayton can draw quality artists through his strong connections with seattle institutions like: wing it, sketchfest, punchline, annex theatre, ghost light theatricals, comedysportz, and many more. along with producing quality shows throughout the year we will also have rehearsal space and classes. rehearsal space   when the theater isn't being used for shows it will be a reasonably priced rehearsal space available to artists who need it. if you're working on an upcoming show in our space you'll even get a discount. also, if we reach the $15,000 stretch goal we'll build a room in the the pocket dedicated to rehearsal/workshops. classes   we believe that training is invaluable for all levels of involvement in the arts. so we'll be offering 3 basic types of classes (specific examples in the rewards section below) : beginners classes: you saw something on our stages and you think you'd like to try it. we'll get you the right instructors and get you comfortable with the new form. at the end you'll have a show for your friends and family. advanced workshops: for those of you who already know what you're doing, but want specific instruction on improving your craft. these multi week classes will whip you into performance shape. master classes: weekly we will bring in an expert to talk on specific topics useful to performers. learn how to talk to press, tour your show, apply to festival, auditions, etc. it's hard to make a living as an artist, but some people have done it. they'll reveal what secrets they can. ( teachers: the pocket will be a very good place at which to teach. we will pay $40 $50/hour, and will have a part time, professional education coordinator who will fill out classes) people are already lining up to do some awesome stuff in the pocket. so may good ideas! here are some: closing night!   an homage to neo futurism   (pat casados) iron sketch   two sketch groups have 30 minutes to make a set based on a 'challenge' (doug willot) oregon trail... live!   jim stewart allen is an expert at oregon trail and will play it live   (jim stewart allen) what do you love?   people speaking on what they're passionate about   (sophie lowenstein) the filling is mutual   special pies baked based on comedians' bits. both for audience consumption   (jen seaman & chris leher) comedysportz   fast paced, team based, short form improv   (alex grindland) submission time   getting stand up sets on tape   (kate montgomery) seattle's harold   long form improv at it's most free form (randall cleveland go game now!   competitive gaming in front of a crowd, plus table top gaming afterward.
