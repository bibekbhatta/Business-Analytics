(stretch goal notes below) reven is a 2d shooter/platformer evolved that will take you back to the good old days of classics like metroid and megaman while adding gameplay twists using our edm system to add rpg elements that can be found in crysis and deus ex . the game is set in the 28th century future on a beautiful and atmospheric planet: xr keres. the theme of the game is duality. the planet's outer beauty only shrouds the ominous terrors that await within its depths. as you explore the world you will uncover many secrets and unravel the mystery on what happened to the terraforming colony that resided on nexum station. who do you play as? (click to enlarge) syrek is 400 year old android war veteran and one of the last surviving member of the exanimen; they were part of the highly successful espionage program: project syphos. he's a highly specialized war machine, who was given the ability to think on his own without the use of a hive mind network. syrek's central processor is 1.618 times more powerful than a human brain, which gives him faster cognitive response time and a vastly superior intellect. he also has the ability to materialize his gun whenever he pleases. he always has a free arm to handle any situation that is thrown at him that would require his second arm. hex tech is the corporation that invented the technology to digitally materialize real metals to form weapons or even store them as data in the edm module on syreks back. this gives him the advantage of having multiple weapons without having to actually carry them. syrek, played a role in shutting down a 100 year rebellion between earth and it's sister colony planets. syrek disappeared towards the end of the war only to resurface when news of nexum station's blackout reached earth. stealing an eg space transport he was last reported seen heading in the direction of nexum in search of something or someone. what about the environments? there are many worlds to explore on xr keres each comprised with their own personalities and species alike. nexum station  a space elevator station used to transport cargo from earth to xr keres. the entire station powered down with no explanation. we fear hundreds of our greatest scientists and their families lost their lives. exteria  a maroon desert plagued by dust storms and high temperatures. the cool caverns below are teaming with alien life of many varieties. eldera  an ancient forest almost as old as the planet itself. the flora and fauna of eldera are so dangerous that all of the research stations had to be built high up in the trees. antaydia  high up in the mountains rests a snow covered plateau, home to antaydia. beneath the frozen tundra lives an entire ecosystem surprisingly drawn to the harsh temperatures. nariss  many creatures reside on the cliffsides of nariss edge overlooking the deep oceans of xr keres. a perpetual thunderstorm continually strikes the ground causing occasional fires. the local lifeforms have adapted to the static charge and have found ways to use it. (the final version of the game will have more places to explore)                                                  game mechanics                                               reven offers a gameplay mechanic that is inspired by rpgs. this mechanic is called the energy divergence module (edm). the edm allows the player to divert energy real time to any of the four parts of syreks body (weapons, shielding, mobility, and sensors) taking power cores from one system and shifting them into another to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. want a more powerful weapon? take energy from your movement speed and increase your damage! losing health too quickly? become a tank by increasing your shield power! we want the player to set up their "stats" the way they want to play, but leave them with the ability to change them on the fly. the gameplay balance is in fact that the player must lose energy in one system to overpower another. however, the world is riddled with power cores, many of which are off the beaten path. find them all to become the ultimate weapon. another feature is the crafting of syrek's abilities from minerals found while digging through the games expansive world. this adds a great deal of exploration and replayability as there will be many secrets and easter eggs throughout the game. (more minerals will be in the game than the ones presented below) the player will have to make some semi permanent decisions on which abilities to construct. while there is nothing stopping the player from unlocking both tiers of abilities within a category, it may be worth balancing their other abilities first. mining areas and minerals are procedurally generated and "reset" every time the player leaves the area. this ensures that the player will always be able to collect enough minerals to construct essential abilities, and also adds replayability to these sections. edm sub system menu (click to expand) each edm category has it's own set of 12 abilities. these abilities are split into 2 groups: top tier and bottom tier. the above image shows the sensors page and displays two energy bars with ability icons above each slot. energy coming into this subsystem via the edm can also be directed into one of the top or bottom menus. abilities with the construction symbol must be constructed before they can be powered on. the next ability in a tier will become available for construction only when the previous one has been made. when a blue energy point is under an ability, the ability turns on and it's effects will begin to function. (click to expand) each weapon has it's own unique set of 4 abilities (3 versions of each) useful for different situations.the burst shock (pictured above) has the bottom tier of abilities geared more towards accuracy and range. the top tier of abilities are built for higher damage and larger projectile size (pictured below). (click to expand) the last three abilities in each tier are later used to open specific doors or create paths through areas. this is important because choosing to construct abilities in the lower tier will enable you to open certain doors, but not others. although there is nothing stopping the player from constructing all abilities in the game, this would take a very long time. (click to expand) deflection enables syrek's shield to reflect projectile attacks sometimes. (click to expand) sprint 1 increases syrek's sprint speed discover lost technologies mysteriously abandoned by the colony members of nexum station throughout the world of keres. gauss rifle   standard issue robotic gauss rifle from the 24th century fires alloy materials using electromagnetic coil accelerators. it's automatic fire quickly shreds targets to pieces in a hail of bullets. this gun may be outdated, but it still packs a serious punch. burst shock   creates a dark blast of ball lightning. has the ability to power on certain devices. it was originally designed to handle large swarms of vermin and giant insects. it was later enhanced to fight off the hoards of infected human. flame strike   blasts a huge torrent of plasma that incinerates enemies with burn damage over time. it's long range and high power make it exceptional at hunting big game. terra beam  a rare device left behind by deep crater mining teams. it's a handheld mining device that emits gravity waves strong enough to manipulate the higgs field tearing matter apart. it's built in rocket grapple is useful both for climbing to new heights, or even pickup up objects to hurl at enemies or place down gently to create steps. a powerful tool indeed. (the game features more weapons than shown above) data indicates that the research and development teams were studying the planets environmental hazards to create coded module gear and equipment for their hazard suits that could withstand keres' atmosphere and dangerous landscapes. finding them will greatly benefit the user as they provide resistances to various hazardous conditions and also give special benefits to specific weapons. once acquired, the player may change gears in game or in the sub menu. shift gear  syrek's default gear. it has the ability to "shift" into other gear modes. it features a repair mode that automatically restores player health. spark gear  an expansion for the burst shock which gives the weapon a charge ability which greatly increases range and attack power. this gear will make you resilient to electrical enemy damage and pass through arcs of electricity unharmed. greatly reduces on screen static noise when struck by lightning. mach gear  expands on the mach speed and mach jump abilities. it gives you the ability to run at speeds that tears the air around you and annihilates enemies. it can also destroy certain walls allowing access to more areas to explore. (the game features more gears than shown here) we want player's to be brought into the reven universe and be completely immersed by the lore and dialogue. we're designing the game to make use of both in game cinematics as well as video animations. originally the game had no voice acting, but we decided to reach a bigger audience by having fully voiced characters, while giving the player the option to turn them off. there are multiple characters that syrek will interact with throughout the game each with their own unique characteristics. the player will also encounter multitudes of back story told through computers and alien lore scattered throughout the game world. making the world of keres and it's creatures feel cohesive and life like is no easy task. we are studying how animals in the real world behave and react to certain situations to make the species of keres feel real. we are going to create an ecosystem that is rich with detail, believable, and atmospheric while maintaining the framework of a video game. we will make xr keres and its inhabitants to feel real and alive. merciless and bloodthirsty as they come. it is documented that the skine will hunt its prey in packs. always watching. always waiting for their next victim. (they usually attack from the sides) "clever girl." never satisfied, crono bats are always looking for their next meal. it is as if their stomach is a bottomless void. we have lost all quantum communications with nexum station. hopefully they're okay. our boss fights will feel fresh and new! because we offer a new way to manage the characters stats and specifications in real time, it gives the player a vast diversity of ways to tackle the obstacles the game throws at them. we want to set a new standard for boss battles in the 2d side  scroller genre. ???? deep terra mining teams have reported hearing screams near sios rim. these "screams" are likely caused by tectonic shifts reverberating through the sios tunnels, drilling should continue as scheduled." everything under bonus content will be released after the game is completed. depending on how successful the game is, we will be releasing beta versions of these expansions. (note: the mission creator will release with the game, but may be missing some key features if certain stretch goals aren't met) the mission creator. one of reven's most anticipated features is the ability to create and share custom levels and mission packs with your friends and the rest of the world. the mission creator makes this possible. players will be using the same tools we're using to build the game so that they can create levels and mission packs to the same quality and complexity as the game's main campaign. our goal is to create a community of people that build and share their own unique stories and challenges for everyone to download and enjoy. the editor will also allow player's to create their own custom levels on their multiplayer servers. this will enable an incredibly diverse array of possibilities for multiplayer and even the development of custom game modes through the level editor's robust trigger system. local coop 4 player survival mode pits players against waves of enemy ai where they must cooperate to survive. online leader boards show the highest wave number and scores achieved by player groups around the world. 2 player coop campaign is a completely fresh and new experience where players must work together to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. this will be available for same system local coop and online coop if the multiplayer expansion stretch goal is reached. if this stretch goal is achieved, we will be hiring several programmers to help us design a multiplayer expansion. beyond the basic game modes you would expect from a shooter style game (deathmatch, tdm, capture the flag, king of the hill) we've created several new game modes that utilize the edm more effectively. more information coming soon! ( strech goal notes) $18,000  the reven exists (the game is funded!) at our 18,000 goal, the game is funded. however, we will have to get part time jobs to help support ourselves until we can finish the game and it will take up to 2 years for the game to release possibly a little longer. we're really not in a position where we can have this  Jimmy Fraud  fail, which is why we chose a smaller initial goal. $25,000  game is up rezzed to 1920x1080 the game resolution is currently in 1024x576, we seriously want to up rez the game for the highest quality possible. if we reach this goal we will be able to make the game in hd. $37,000  the game is completed faster we will focus all of our time and energy into creating this game and will be fully supported and able to release the game much sooner than expected, same goes for all the rewards!

"you know what we need? our handy dandy note book!". it was at that very moment i knew i wanted to become an artist! i was mesmerized with the idea of creating my own worlds. after nearly 17 years of expanding my skills and practicing i am ready to show the world what i am capable of. funny how it all started from watching someone draw a couch on tv. who would have guessed it? mark mclemore musical genius sound effects artist my love for video game music (and the recorded sound) goes all the way back to when i was a kid, capturing my favorite game music on my fisher price 3818 cassette recorder. so what can you expect from the reven score? memorable melodies, powerful orchestration and gripping moods. music and ambiance are an integral part of any video game experience, and i’m honored to have the task of creating the sonic atmosphere for reven. it’s going to be a good time. . ian stanley content promotion marketing video games came into my life at an early age. my most fond memory is sitting with my brother in front of our nes playing the legend of zelda: a link to the past. growing up, i found myself very business minded though. i made multiple websites directed for gaming communities, indie promotion, etc. my love for gaming and business alike led me to get a bachelors degree in business. i aim to use my degree for my biggest passion   gaming! bernardo rozewicz content promotion marketing my marketing mindset has been in play since middle school. back then it was selling trading cards at a huge profit in the school yard, now it's promoting this amazing game. when varia games approached me with this opportunity i was ecstatic. the only thing that rivals my passion for marketing is my passion for gaming. i'm getting the best of both worlds! i've been a gamer since childhood; i have very fond memories of running around as super sonic. i've been studying business   marketing for 6 years now. i plan to use both my skill sets to help make reven the best game possible. we decided that launching a  Jimmy Fraud  would be the best chance we have of continuing production of the game and (hopefully) fully fund the project so we can get it done. we are tired of games being made the same with little to no new innovations so we quit our jobs to become non shackled indie developers so we could create a game that feels fresh and new while maintaining a sense of familiarity. our goal is to create a memorable experience that people play again and again, and even expand upon through the mission creator. we've been living off our savings to get all of the groundwork going for this game. one of us had to sell our car to get enough money for a plane ticket home in case things go wrong. we really hope you like our game and see the value it offers for being so modestly priced. we really appreciate all of the support from friends and family as well as many strangers who have become fans of reven. thanks varia games risks and challenges developing a game of this scope requires a tremendous amount of time and man hours. the risk involved with any video game project is mainly a financial one. we have come a long way in such a short time while having distractions beyond our control and living off of what little savings we had. the game up to this point has been developed on a laptop in 4 months. our current hardware is struggling to run the game making tools. this  Jimmy Fraud  will help by allowing us to overcome all these challenges and make the game the best experience possible within a shorter time frame. we are very passionate about games and fell in love with video games at a young age; we have been dreaming of the day we could create our own project. that day is nigh, for we are fully equipped with razor sharp degrees in computer science and game art. our knowledge is extensive and we plan to harness every skill set we have to make this game as polished and impressive as it can be. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
