retch goal with this fundraiser's quick success, i have dreamt bigger for what i would do if i raised more $$ than the minimum needed to reach my $5k goal. i am thrilled to see that these expanded dreams are possible. if i raise my additional dream stretch goal, still wonder full will be able to live on past the june performances – as a short film! this short dance film will use the high resolution footage from the still wonder full performances – woven together in a new way – with additional studio footage to create a stand alone, 5 10 minute work of video art. still wonder full is a new, evening length solo performance by seattle artist, britt karhoff. this reflection on the complexity and spectacle of loss blends recorded interviews and fleeting recollections, together with original song and britt's signature loose, athletic dance movement . she's bringing together a talented team of designers and collaborators to build interactive sets, engineer sound that weaves story fragments and song, and light the lofty performance space of base. why am i doing this? as i settle into my mid 30's, the value of making and participating in performance work is coming into sharper focus. this rigorous, investigative, vulnerable work allows me to inspect my world more closely, to reflect on my place and to grapple with all the mess and beauty that being human brings... which then makes space for you to examine your own messes and beauties. this process of creating performances brings people together... to design, to weigh decisions, to show up and witness. and in a world that conspires to pull us further apart, this coming together matters even more. i want to get tangled, take risks, fall hard and hold fast to community as we sort through our personal odysseys. still wonder full began as a way to process and reflect on the confluence of major life events that were challenging my sense of identity: motherhood, late term abortion for a much wanted pregnancy, home ownership and a career wake up call. as i sift through these experiences, i'm searching for the commonalities, the familiar, the pieces that tie us together. collaborators lighting design/ marnie

while i've created many shorter solos and group performance works, this is my first evening length piece – which means i will be filling the entire show. just me. this is both a little terrifying and quite freeing. instead of being limited in the length of the work or the capacity of the space, i have a giant open room and a substantial period of time to engage with viewers. as i continue to develop my process and voice in solo performance, i've found it critical to bring others into the development and creation along the way. this connection to my community informs and pushes my work in big ways. still wonder full also marks a shift in how i think about the value of my work. this is the first time i'm reaching out to my community to fund my work in such a big way. i've always felt called to performing and art, but have been undermining it's worth. i've been fighting against a fear that it is a frivolous endeavor, backed by a general devaluing of art in our capitalist world. and all along, this work has been serving the things i value most: speaking up, supporting other artists, challenging authority, building tight relationships, and providing space to reflect. thank you for supporting me. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
