ionartcenter college of design was founded in 1930 in downtown los angeles as the art center school. in 1935, fred r. archer founded the photography department, and ansel adams was a guest instructor in the late 1930s. during and after world war ii, artcenter ran a technical illustration program in conjunction with the california institute of technology. in 1947, the post war boom in students caused the school to expand to a larger location in the building of the former cumnock school for girls in the hancock park neighborhood, while still maintaining a presence at its original downtown location. the school began granting bachelor's and master's degrees in arts in 1949, and was fully accredited by the western association of schools and colleges in 1955. in 1965, the school changed its name to art center college of design. the school expanded its programs, including a film program in 1973. the school moved to the hillside campus in pasadena in 1976. the school operated art center europe in la tour de peilz, switzerland from 1986 to 1996. in 2003, artcenter was granted non governmental organization status by the un department of public information. artcenter opened the south campus in pasadena in 2004. the issue of the legitimacy of ngos raises a series of important questions. this is one of the most important assets possessed by an ngo, it is gained through a perception that they are an “independent voice”. their representation also emerges as an important question. who bestows responsibilities to ngos or ingos and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society ? "when we realize that ingos hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome." student body make up when the school systems began to fail my mentor & respected college of design alumni, kept his studio open, took me to lectures at art center where i developed a relationship with mmparis after hearing them speak and winning their book m to m of m/m (paris) in a raffle i won, (i actually had two winning tickets!) my relationship with music & art changed after learning they did the art work for kanye west " my beautiful dark twisted fantasy album cover. heres the problem: vada (visual arts & design academy) an almost separate campus of pasadena high school were we practiced all aspects of art & sociaidesign . the people i met in vada were the most talented diverse people i know were completely pushed away by the forces that be away from their local   global institutions such as art center. the united states school to prison link or school to prison pipeline a metaphor used to describe the increasing patterns of contact students have with the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems as a result of the recent practices implemented by educational institutions, specifically zero tolerance policies and the use of police in schools. the metaphor is currently a hot topic of debate in discussions surrounding educational disciplinary policies as media coverage of youth violence and mass incarceration has grown over the past decade or so. where there was supposed to be a back door to art center. many barely support their families or god given crafts. some on drugs lost with no sense of self identity, jail & or in organized gangs. no sustainability. pasadena homicides victor rios : help for kids the education system ignores you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 define students by what they contribute, not what they lack — especially those with difficult upbringings , says educator victor rios . interweaved with his personal tale of perseverance as an inner city youth, rios identifies three straightforward strategies to shift attitudes in education and calls for fellow educators to see "at risk" students as "at promise" individuals brimming with resilience, character and grit . via tedx the vision thing seeing and creating change through design design offers a different way of reading the visual environment, navigating culture, and understanding the systems that shape our world. designers know all about the manufacture of desire and dissatisfaction, selling images and ideas. design education puts these tools in the hands of students and creates openings for greater self expression. this is not just expression of emotion and style, but self expression in a fuller, richer sense – as an expression of values and of one’s own power. in cities around the world, the town square is the heart of the community. it pulses with conversation, music, and celebration. not just the geographic center, a well designed square nourishes social life. and when the square is neglected, public life is diminished . it’s is not just in design schools. it’s not just in mentorship programs at top shelf firms.

policies that recognize and promote the rights of nature to exist, thrive and evolve. members of the group believe that recognizing and implementing the rights of nature in law is necessary to begin to reverse what they regard as a trend of environmental degradation. concurrently, the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. this in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. both trends started in the 1980s. the driehaus architecture prize is an award that recognizes efforts in new urbanism and new classical architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist pritzker prize. main article: sustainable architecture sustainable building design sustainable architecture is the design of sustainable buildings. sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the lifecycle of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) this design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems; alternative energy sources such as solar hot water, appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on site power generation   solar technology , ground source heat pumps, wind power; rainwater harvesting for gardening, washing and aquifer recharge; and on site waste management such as green roofs that filter and control stormwater runoff. this requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation. an essential element of sustainable building design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustics. the integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure. the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards. symbolism of the x . speaking to the crossroad, is the larger metaphor , the idea of the graphical device represents a place, it’s where people meet; it is the intersection — the center of the universe of communing and community; it could be the marketplace, the nexus. but that idea of plane and place has magical import, as well — the x marks the netherworld where spirits can come, pass through, and exit the world that we know, and perhaps draw us into another. the crossroads might be emblematic of the spiritual confusion, or the place of decision making — it is here that you’ll have to make the call to which direction you might hold in your heart. the x is the four points of the cardinal direction, it’s the place where all points of the sphere of being can reach back to the centerpoint of the locus — the locality — of where you are. in that, as well – it is the spheric and multidimensional conformed as one planar nexus — the point where things come together. or come apart. as the planes touch, in that instant, the experiencer is neither in one world or the other — twixt and twain, in between and apart — the place of liminality. the intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design" manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources, impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. beyond the "elimination of negative environmental impact", sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour. a dynamic balance between economy and society, intended to generate long term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences. sustainable technologies use less energy, fewer limited resources, do not deplete natural resources, do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life. there is significant overlap with appropriate technology, which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context, in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries. however, the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one; and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an "appropriate technology," as that term is commonly used. taken to the public sphere, design skills become transformative. a common theme in the stories above is the relationship between ordinary folks and public space. in each case, artists, designers, and students are intervening to shape the visual and built environment to benefit their communities. design is a powerful means of expressing a vision for what change might look like. taking it public

great design. this includes better user experience and comfort, doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance, and maximizing the effectives of durable, quality materials. rather than the well known edict “form follows function,” it’s time to think “form follows environment.” beyond the "elimination of negative environmental impact", sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour. a dynamic balance between economy and society, intended to generate long term relationships between user and object/service

officially opened to the public at hazard park in boyle heights, los angeles. this exciting new plaza wouldn’t have been possible without the support of diamond supply co., the street league foundation and the california endowment and the city of los angeles. the diamond supply co. public skate plaza at hazard park came to life after the street league foundation approached the california endowment last year about working together to create healthy sustainable communities by constructing safe, legal and accessible places for everyone to skate. sls was stoked to bring our long time series partner into the mix, and diamond supply co. generously donated matching funds to make the plaza a reality. sustainable landscaping, and sustainable gardening sustainable landscape architecture is a category of sustainable design and energy efficient landscaping concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space. plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation. design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind, using local materials, and on site composting and chipping not only to reduce green waste hauling but to increase organic matter and therefore carbon in the soil. some designers and gardeners such as beth chatto also use drought resistant plants in arid areas (xeriscaping) and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and habitats for irrigation. water from building roofs may be collected in rain gardens so that the groundwater is recharged, instead of rainfall becoming surface runoff and increasing the risk of flooding. areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage bio diversity. native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways: by plants which provide food such as nectar and pollen for insects, or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees, or habitats such as ponds for amphibians and aquatic insects. pesticides, especially persistent pesticides, must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife. soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to ground cover plants and mulches to increase organic matter and therefore earthworms and mycorrhiza; nitrogen fixing plants instead of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers; and sustainably harvested seaweed extract to replace micronutrients. sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental, growing food, firewood and craft materials from beautiful places. sustainable landscape approaches and labels include organic farming and growing, permaculture, agroforestry, forest gardens, agroecology, vegan organic gardening, ecological gardening and climate friendly gardening. social design thinking within the design world joins developing human and social capital with new products and processes that are profitable. profitability and ownership of the processes are the cornerstones of sustainability that underpins human well being. another author that contributes to the development of this definition of social design is victor margolin. he writes in "the politics of the artificial" about the "designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well being." this ideology is something that social design is built on.in this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity, aid donations, help etc. it is not voluntary work, but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local economic development or livelihood. risks and challenges a bureaucracy is "a body of non elective government officials" and/or "an administrative policy making group". historically, bureaucracy was government administration managed by departments staffed with non elected officials.today, bureaucracy is the administrative system governing any large institution.the public administration in many countries is an example of a bureaucracy. since being coined, the word "bureaucracy" has developed negative connotations. bureaucracies have been criticized as being too complex, inefficient, or too inflexible.the dehumanizing effects of excessive bureaucracy became a major theme in the work of franz kafka, and were central to his novels, the castle and the trial.the elimination of unnecessary bureaucracy is a key concept in modern managerial theory and has been an issue in some political campaigns. others have noted the necessity of bureaucracies in modern life. the german sociologist max weber argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which one can organize human activity, and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies were necessary to maintain order, maximize efficiency and eliminate favoritism. weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to individual freedom, in which an increase in the bureaucratization of human life can trap individuals in an impersonal "iron cage" of rule based, rational control. street level bureaucracy is the subset of a public agency or government institution where the civil servants work who have direct contact with members of the general public. street level civil servants carry out and/or enforce the actions required by a government's laws and public policies, in areas ranging from safety and security to education and social services. a few examples include police officers, border guards, social workers and public school teachers. these civil servants have direct contact with members of the general public, in contrast with civil servants who do policy analysis or economic analysis, who do not meet the public. street level bureaucrats act as liaisons between government policy makers and citizens and these civil servants implement policy decisions made by senior officials in the public service and/or by elected officials. the concept of street level bureaucracy was first coined by michael lipsky in 1969, who argued that "policy implementation in the end comes down to the people (the street level bureaucrats)] who actually implement it". however, the process of street level bureaucracy has been around for a much longer period. a "government will be better accepted if its administrators [e.g., bureaucrats] reflect the origins [and needs] of its people", an ideal which embodies the goals of an effective street level bureaucracy in america. some of the first street level bureaucrats in the us were post office officials and administrators. the presidency of woodrow wilson helped to spur a large growth in public administration and government policy making, which in turn led to larger sized and better funded street level bureaucracies. however it was not until the 1950s with the baby boom that street level bureaucracy became as strong as a presence in society as it is in the 2000s. lipsky describes street level bureaucrats as the "human face" of policy, since these individuals interact directly with citizens.the history of street level bureaucracy follows the history of policy development and the scope of government in america, with areas with larger populations and more government policies employing more public servants (e.g., chicago which employs 26,680 teachers). due to street level bureaucrats' close interactions with citizens, day to day application of discretion in their assessment of people's cases and issues, and their role as policy interpreters, lipsky claims that "in a sense the street level bureaucrats implicitly mediate aspects of the constitutional relationship of citizens to the state. in short, they hold the keys to a dimension of citizenship." the interpretation of the duties, scope, and responsibilities of street level bureaucrats are still debated in the 2000s, with ongoing discussion on the roles of discretion, accountability, lack of resources, and technology and concerns raised about the risks of corruption.
