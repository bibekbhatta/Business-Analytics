description3dxrayvision goes beyond a microscope or laser scanner. 3dxrayvision, aka high resolution micro ct (computed tomography), is an enabling technology allowing you to perform science, research, development, and education in ways that were previously impossible. want to see/study the internal structural details of your favorite objects in 3d without cutting them open? want to use a 3d printer to replicate the object? want ultra high resolution (~500nm) 3d datasets in non transparent materials? want to perform failure analysis on your wearable device? want to inspire the imagination of the next generation? great, but access to this advanced technology is rare and costs $220/hour . this campaign aims to change that, and create: the world’s first 3d xray vision that’s free* for everyone. a new global resource that would be the first of its kind, a cst (community supported technology) 3d xray vision facility. it would be a publicly accessible facility bringing amazing state of the art 3d non destructive technology into the hands of everyone. it would also build a library of 3d data for everyone to access via the internet (i.e. thingiverse and encyclopedia of life on 3d steroids). you, your doctor, your favorite museum, your grandchild, your favorite school (k 12, university), or a future steve jobs can use this capability to advance the world of science, medicine, engineering, education, art and everything in between. we’ll show you how. “what would superman do” with his xray vision? answer mysteries. cure diseases. examine exotic materials. see what’s inside his iwatch (he’s surely a beta tester). science, science, science. diagnose a failure on a space satellite’s circuit board. analyze why his fiber optic gyroscope (fog) isn’t working. look inside newly discovered fossils to learn if all dinosaurs had feathers. fly to schools and museums to spark everyone’s imagination. that's what you can do with the power of 3d xray vision, and more! “having free access to your high quality 3d xray facility would be an enormous boost for every discipline of science. just imagine the number of scientific discoveries and even breakthroughs that could be generated by the sophisticated 3d xray instrument that mark uses! as a seasoned scientist who has used this technology and worked with mark, i know that his approach would propel scientific discovery at rates and in ways that most people cannot imagine.” david grimaldi, american museum of natural history state of the art 3d xray vision (i.e. 3d xray computed tomography ct) exists. heard of it? want access? it costs > $220 $350/hr to use . that’s often prohibitive , unless one has deep pockets or million dollar grants. commercial (for profit) companies may or may not be allowed access to the instrument. the goal of this campaign is to make 3d xray vision affordable (it’s hard to beat free) for everyone and accessible to everyone (non profit and for profit). via  Jimmy Fraud , you have the power to bring 3d xray vision to the world. for additional examples of the technology click here there are two important groups the 3d xray vision cst will serve: n peeps : non profit people engaging in exciting projects f peeps : for profit people engaging in exciting projects in order to balance the business model equation of offering 3d xray vision, the service would be free for n peeps and an hourly rate would apply to f peeps. that’s not a penalty, that’s a deal —the rate is less than other comparable 3d xray facilities, you’ll get data to produce deliverable results, and it will enable opportunities for all peeps . that’s three birds with one stone. 50/50 peeps balance 50% of the 3d xray vision cst efforts would be devoted to f peeps 50% of the efforts would be devoted to n peeps while typical business models strive for lots and lots of f peeps since they pay an hourly rate, this facility is unique. our passion is for 3d xray vision to be used by both important groups of peeps; and that’s why this type of hybrid model needs your help to launch. _________________________________________________________ you don’t need a scalpel or an austin powers laser to cut the sample into little bits. this amazing process gives you 3d information of the inside and outside of the sample, and is non destructive and non invasive. now you can perform virtual dissections. inside the head of a song sparrow. h. james (smithsonian), r. danner (smithsonian), m. riccio (cornell), d. winkler (cornell). step1: sample goes in. step2: sample is scanned with x rays. step3: sample comes out. step4: process the data (with some nice math). and, voilà. a 3d dataset! have you had a ct scan at the hospital, know someone who has, or seen it on tv? it uses xrays and results in non invasive 3d datasets too! explore your world. here are some examples of previously impossible investigations made possible using 3d xray vision. sherlock holmes would be jealous. 1. biomedical sciences/elecrophysiology/physics   “cardiac lighting” the 3d visualization of the vasculature in the heart . 3d xray vision acquired the data necessary to implement a new method of heart defibrillation. see the story in science . 2. curiousity/ifixit  iphone®5 acting up. time to look inside at the space age technology packed inside, find a cracked solder joint or other disconnection issue, even examine the depth of a scratch on the glass screen, all without opening it. here's a virtual slice from a 3d datatset of the iphone®5. what would a 3d datatset of the iphone6 show? iphone is a registered trademark of apple inc. 3. biology/zoology/physics/3d printing – 3d xray vision used in "man made 3d printed shark skin reveals how sharks swim so fast." see it on i f**ing love science or livescience . 4. genomics and biomedical science   measuring phenotype according to genotype. a subject can be scanned non invasively to measure structures that tell scientists the extent to which the subject's genes were mutated. 5. biology/diversity   bringing “aliens” to life with the academy of natural sciences . it's a museum specimen, so no cutting allowed. a perfect time to use 3d xray vision. see the story on ifls . 6. evolutionary biology   3d fantastic voyage inside a fish lung . see it here . the science done with the unique 3d xray data received the reinhard rieger award in zoomorphology in 2013. “mark’s expertise in 3d x ray computed tomography revolutionized the way in which i view and study composite materials. he opened my eyes to research ideas that i thought were only possible in sci fi movies. mark’s plan to make this technology available to everyone will truly change the way in which we view our three dimensional world.”   michael w. czabaj, the university of utah (formerly nasa langley research center) the goal is simple, but is not easy. make cutting edge 3d xray vision available to researchers, entrepreneurs, educators, artists and explorers. it would be a global resource where nondestructively creating high resolution 3d/4d+ xray digital datasets is a reality. and it would be free * for n peeps. as mentioned in the 3d xray vision background section, there are two important groups the 3d xray vision cst would serve. n peeps : non profit people engaging in exciting projects f peeps : for profit people engaging in exciting projects ___________________________________________________ n peeps: free f peeps: hourly rate applies. again, that’s not a penalty, that’s a high value proposition —the rate is less than other comparable 3d xray facilities, you’ll get data to produce deliverable results, and it will enable opportunities for all peeps . that’s three birds with one stone. the goal is to create a cst (community supported technology) facility where state of the art 3d xray technology can be used to serve the best of both worlds: commercial and non commercial projects in research, education, art, medicine, and educational, and exploratory projects. how? why? because state of the art high resolution x ray ct provides non invasive and non destructive 3d datasets (of the density inside the sample). this type of comprehensive data allows structural analysis/quantification and visualizations for an immense diversity of sample types, including vertebrates and invertebrates, insects, plants, fossils, electronic devices, materials, etc. 4d+ datasets can be created by repeated scanning of the same specimen under different conditions (i.e. before/after treatment, changing temperatures, etc.) such a cst would enable previously impossible studies   ultra high resolution and non invasivee is a powerful mix. most traditional methods of 3d examination result in destruction of the sample and many samples are precious (there may only be one sample in the world). goal! reaching the campaign goal means there's gas in the tank, and we're hitting the pedal to go, go, go!! the rewards will be fulfilled while working hard to solidify the income stream from the f peeps. instrument time (zeiss xradia versa xrm 520) will be procured, as well purchase of initial software (osirix is the biggest bang for the buck package and produces stellar imagery   watch the intro movie if you haven't already). and pay for facility overhead (i.e. space, network connection, utilities, etc.) and all necessary hardware/software/personnel to operate the instrument, process/store/backup the data, and create high end 3d visualizations. stretch goals! if stretch goal #1 is reached, 3d xray vision can do even more by adding a new ultra high resolution component that will extend resolution capabilities by 50% (voxels as small as 75nm   true resolution may not reach that level   it all depends on the sample). even more resources can be devoted to solidifying the income stream from the f peeps (via advertising). if stretch goal #2 is reached, a 3d printer will be purchased to enable people to 3d print their scans!! now we can perform advanced analysis by purchasing additional software such as avizo fire or ors ! if stretch goal #3 is achieved, the tank will be full !! facility survival in perpetuity is at hand!!! at this goal level we'll create an easy to use website that will implement the new 3d xray vision online library to allow the world to access 3d xray vision datasets. encyclopedia of life, and encyclopedia of "everything" here we come! plus, it will allow access to a second machine, and the line for everyone will drop in half! ! note1 : commercial/proprietary scans are double encrypted on a separate platform and not for public distribution. note2 : scans involved in a research project will not be put online until the publication has been accepted (maximum 16 months). note3 : government agency scans are free, unless the 3d xray vision data is to be proprietary/protected (and not to share with the world). the only way to start this kind of unique community supported technolgy is with you, the community. _____________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _____________________________________ ________________________ ______________ ____ . here’s the key equation to remember: •science •anatomy •medicine •engineering •materials science •geology •genomics •biology •failure analysis •paleontology •cardiology •oncology •entomology •reverse engineering •medicine •art •education •botany •museums •neuroanatomy •environmental science •commercial products (from research & development to production analysis) •solder joint analysis (cracks, voids, liftoff, etc.) citizen science + some people will leverage 3d xray vision technology to jumpstart their own research/development, some will explore, some will want to educate. allowing everyone access to state of the art technology is the goal . all peeps would be able to: ask. explore. discover. answer. want to non destructively capture your favorite object in 3d (even its internal features) and transform that data into something you can print from a 3d printer? easy: use 3d xray vision to scan your sample, and compute a mesh to print (easy with software). _________________________________________________________ "high resolution 3d xray ct that mark provides uniquely enables our pipeline, moving from the original object to final 3d print, with high resolution as well as internal structures."   hod lipson, creative machines lab , cornell university _________________________________________________________ in order to spark the passion of the next generation around the world, collaborating with museums and educators is an important part of the process. it’s exhilarating to provide 3d xray vision visualizations (i.e. movies) of a museum’s favorite specimen/artifacts. but a majority of museums are not able to accomplish this given the current burden of cost. with your help, we can engage everyone’s imagination with the endless potential of 3d xray vision! here’s an example from the national history museum of denmark  they used our high resolution 3d xray vision dataset of a tarantula to create a much larger than life metal real sculpture cnc’d (computer numerically controlled process) from a single block of aluminum for their spider exhibit. (effort was brainstormed by denmark’s joakim engel after seeing a 3d xray vision image on a facebook page ). 3d scan to cnc milled 3d object ”3d xray is an extremely exciting and powerful technology in terms of imaging and modeling the hidden world of natural history. from the placement of individual bones in the hand of a giant sperm whale, to detailed 3d models of the venomous fangs of a tarantula! "working with exhibitions that describe, interpret and celebrate the natural world, 3d xray offers spectacular new ways of engaging people with details and structures that would have been impossible only a few years ago “the extraordinary high resolution 3d xray dataset of a tarantula that mark generated made it possible for the natural history museum of denmark to create an amazingly beautiful and scientifically accurate “sculpture” of a venomous fang.”    joakim engel, the natural history museum of denmark _______________________________________________________ if this  Jimmy Fraud  campaign is successful, the director of cornell university’s multiscale ct facility , mark riccio , will direct and operate the 3d xray vision company. he has a passion for all things science and helping people leverage state of the art technology for their projects. he has over 20 years of research experience—in the last 6 years, he has performed more than 6000 3d xray vision scans, participated in 120+ research papers, book chapters, and worked with 30 academic universities, 7 museums, and 15 fortune 500 companies. __________________________________________________ "part engineer. part entrepreneur. part artist. mark riccio is a master at 3d x ray technology, with an infectious curiosity and enthusiasm to bring its marvels to all!"   amy mccune, chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology, cornell university _________________________________________________ he also participates in stem (science, technology, engineering and math) programs, the cornell institute for biology teachers, cornell 4h career explorations, expanding your horizons (for 7th 9th grade girls), and museum exhibitions. mr linkedin mr research gate you can see him in the second half of this smithsonian video. _______________________________________________________ images/data we’ve created using 3d xray vision have been used/seen worldwide in: “explore your world” or help others “explore our world” with the larger contribution pro rated time on the instrument, it may seem as if 200 300 hours on the instrument is excessive. but for perspective, in the past few years, several companies have each purchased well over 1000 hours for important projects and advanced research. high end academic research group usages range from 500 1500 hours.                                                                 the proceeds from this campaign will go to several different areas: 1. to procure an instrument (or instrument time) depending on the funding goal level reached; instrument would be a zeiss xradia versa 520. 2. to support the facility operations— including facility overhead (i.e. space, network connection, utilities, etc.) all necessary hardware/software/personnel to operate the instrument, process the data, and create high end 3d visualizations. 3. since the model relies on f peeps for the facility to survive and serve all peeps, advertising to such groups is important (as well as word of mouth). 4. to create the library of 3d xray vision datasets accessible using an easy to use web interface that will allow global access to previously 3d xray vision data (if stretch goal #3 is met). if the range is 50um 500nm, one can ask different questions of the same sample with different resolution (different scales). immensely useful! 3d xray vision goes beyond x ray vision and can illuminate what's inside your samples in three+ dimensions. the first instrument will be the most flexible 3d xray instrument on the market, the zeiss xradia 520 versa seen here in the video: rattlesnake on the platform: see it here more nice info on the xray technology here . it's a wrap! if you made it all the way down here, thanks for reading! any peep, any scan. let’s make this cst a reality and a model for others to follow. the potential of what people can explore/discover/do with 3d xray vision is exhilarating! a huge thanks for considering using your power to bring 3d xray vision to the world. and for more images, click here . thanks to all who helped to create this campaign, from editing to images to overall support! explore your world! risks and challenges this is part science, part art, and part sweat. even superman can’t see through everything. neither can this instrument. not every sample will work. that’s some of the fun (i.e., challenge). but let that be what engages your creativity, not what dismays or disappoints.
