riptionthat's it, folks. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 thank you all so much for making peter and john possible. we've had a steady influx of support on  Jimmy Fraud  and from the community on nantucket and it has meant the world to us. rather than just sending this thank you video to our donors, we decided to post it online for everyone to see. even if you couldn't give money, you shared our links, talked about the film, gave us your time or your homes or your antique furniture! we can't thank you enough. stay up to date with the production on our facebook page and on twitter @peteretjohn .                                                       donation matching big news. we have a donor who will match the next $5,000 in donations made on  Jimmy Fraud . that means if you give $100, we get $200. if we get $5,000 in the next 3 days, we really get $10,000. this will pay for two additional days of production that we need to complete the script. kake kredit: kate from walla walla we won't eat this cake until we can pay for those two extra days of shooting. don't make us wait! it looks so tasty! why stop here? thanks to you, we hit our goal early. we realized that if all of our donors gave $13 more, we'd hit $60,000. it is possible to achieve that in 3 days! given that, we'd like to set some stretch goals. here's what we could do with just a little bit more from our supporters: $60,000 we could add a desperately needed extra day of shooting to the schedule. this would allow us to film a handful of sequences that would increase the production values of the film exponentially. $65,000 with this extra money, we could expand next summer's tour of the film to include a huge number of cities and towns beyond what we're planning for right now. this means more people brought into the circle of this new kind of independent filmmaking. $75,000 now we're talking festival entry fees, digital distribution and major exposure to the broader film community. $100,000 alright, maybe a bit pie in the sky. but with this extra funding we could truly show the world that there's a new model out there for regional filmmaking and film education, that doesn't have to rely on old models for success. with your help, we've already changed the way movies are made. let's push the boundaries on what's possible.                                                       thanks to you, we made our goal. here we are, 3 days from the end and we've already raised more than our goal. we can't thank you all enough. it's truly a validation of our efforts that you have all come together in support of our vision of regional cinema and this groundbreaking model. we'll keep updating through the end of the campaign, so don't go away. thanks to all. we're nearly there! 300 backers and counting as a special thank you, there's a new blog up by jay and here's a photo collage celebrating our generous donors. if you haven't donated yet, you're missing out on exclusive videos that go behind the scenes of the making of the film. don't be left out!                                                       special connections guess what we found out recently?

we’re 20 professionals and 30 students and we're making peter and john with veteran indie director jay craven whose work is known for its commitment to place based character driven films set in new england. our film intensive program is called movies from marlboro    and this is the second time that marlboro college has partnered with kingdom county productions (a 501(c)(3) non profit film and arts producer) and director/teacher jay craven to facilitate this rigorous and transformative project. student katie barsotti checking out the camera this 16 week intensive immerses students and professionals into the kind of collaboration that fosters creative community    as students take on substantial roles in production design, camera and lights, casting, costume design, script supervising, and every aspect of production. everybody gets their own coffee. we’ve already been at it for two months  and we’re becoming a passionate and very resourceful film crew   dedicated to making a successful, entertaining, and culturally rich movie intended for release deep into new england and across the country. about the film adapted from maupassant’s ground breaking novel, peter & john , tells the story of peter roland, a sober and straight laced physician and former civil war medic who seeks to build his practice and improve his fortunes on the largely poor and quiet island of nantucket. the film takes place during the island’s “ghost period,” after the decline of whaling and before the rise of tourism. peter enjoys a cozy bond with his mother, louise, and a spirited and sometimes competitive relationship with brother john. when the roland family attorney interrupts a household dinner with news of an unexpected inheritance for john, peter darkens. then, a striking and mysterious young woman arrives on the island, intensifying complications. peter & john follows the journey of the roland family brought to the breaking point by secrets, suspicions, and shattered illusions. peter and john digs into themes of family, status, class, self discovery, and the lengths to which someone will go to reveal or suppress the truth. henry james called guy de maupassant’s story “a masterly little novel” for its rich and clever psychological characterizations. vincent van gogh wrote to his brother saying, simply, "it's beautiful." what’s our plan? we’ve completed our vermont based study and pre production. our script is ready and our cast will be announced in mid march, as we head to the island to ramp up production. we’ll also hold community script readings and workshops, once we're there, as part of our effort to create a transparent production and invite community involvement. filming begins april 3rd and we’ll be at it for five weeks, day and night. our student crew is busy finding locations, researching props, and pulling costumes from warehouses in new york, connecticut, and los angeles. the art department has found island horses, and tracked down 19th century carriages and boats. nantucket is perhaps america’s best preserved example of an 18th and 19th century seaside community   it is a piece of history that lives and breathes according to its own contemporary rhythms. the island’s preserved and polished elements create an extraordinary opportunity for our independent production working on a lean budget. our behind the scenes crew out on the nantucket moors our work is being greatly facilitated by the island’s fabulous cultural community: the nantucket historical association, nantucket atheneum, nantucket conservation foundation, maria mitchell association, theater workshop of nantucket, nantucket dreamland theater, nantucket high school, and remain nantucket. without these key allies, none of what we’re planning could happen. jack fritsch of nantucket's antiques depot we’re close! we’ve raised $522,000 toward our budget of $625,000. so, we’re close. but we need to meet our goal    and we’re looking to friends, family, indie film enthusiasts, and supporters of engaged education and the idea of a sustainable place based cinema. you can play a leading role as we work to make cinema history here in new england! we’ll reward you with tickets, dvd’s, production artifacts, and more. please support us   students and professionals working together for love and not money to make an enduring and entertaining motion picture. donations are tax deductible. we’ll provide updates during every phase of production and release. join our creative community as we work to achieve all we imagine. we want to share our experience with you, so please, if you have any questions, let us know. what about the filmmakers? do they know how to make a great movie? our experienced filmmakers have brought many successful films to fruition. director of photography brad heck has more than 100 credits, including six feature films and a dozen documentaries. costume designer sarah beers holds a 2013 emmy award for her work on the history channel favorite, the men who built america . her other credits include the academy award nominated picture, maria full of grace . director jay craven has made six feature films, five documentaries, and an emmy winning regional comedy tv series. his films have played 53 countries and 72 film festivals including sundance. special screenings include the smithsonian and lincoln center. visiting artists and mentors include production designer/art director alan muraoka ( little miss sunshine, ghost world, washington square ), assistant director/writer allan nicholls (assistant director on robert altman’s the player and short cuts ), and others. other professional crew include mostly young and emerging professionals. they include michael toscano (line producer), russell bartlett (production manager), kate merrill and sadie wechsler (production design), dave richards (location sound mixer), willow o'feral (props and still photography), patrick kennedy (assistant camera), dan finlayson (digital image technician), josh melrod (editor), hannah mccarthy (pr and fundraising), ben mankoff (pr and mentor for behind the scenes documentary), alison pugh (assistant costume designer) and anna pinchuk (assistant editor). students include charlie manclark (boston college), lizzie whittaker (mount holyoke), elodie munezero (mount holyoke), hortense lingjaerde (sarah lawrence) katie barsotti (wellesley college), ayana aaron (wellesley), abra white (wellesley), adrienne ogle (wellesley), lilly tyson (wellesley), gladys raygoza (wellesley), abbey volmer (emerson), lena wilson (smith), josh cobb (lyndon state college), dave king (university of vermont), meg reilly (university of vermont), grace dineen (nantucket high school), francine fayette (burlington college), lynn chlemecky (marlboro college), jake morely (marlboro), connor lancaster (marlboro), reily mumpton (marlboro), saskia giramma (marlboro), luke becker lowe (marlboro), nick sanchez (marlboro), chris pratt (marlboro), rebecca meade , jenny smyth (marlboro), ellie peterson (dartmouth), and sean allen (antioch). why is peter and john different? imagine being an aspiring young cinematographer, director, production designer, editor, actor, or documentary filmmaker. you take college classes and make good short films but the larger world of feature filmmaking seems distant and inaccessible. you’d like to be really challenged – to get hands on experience that teams you up with seasoned professionals and immerses you in the culture of an ambitious film shoot. and you’d like to play a vital role in the making of a substantial feature film that will make its way onto movie screens, dvds, festivals, and tv. you’ve got a hundred questions – how do i light a night scene? how does art direction flesh out a story? how do i get resonant performances from my actors? how do i analyze and adjust a script that’s headed into production? what does a producer, an assistant director, or a script supervisor do? where do i find working mentors who will lead me through the intensive practices of feature filmmaking and challenge me to show what i can do? how can i find peers to help me articulate my own filmmaking vision—and how can i possibly raise the crucial money i need to make it happen? the answer: the movies from marlboro production of peter and john . why is this kind of film making important? our new filmmaking partnership responds directly to the difficulties young filmmakers and seasoned independents face as they try to navigate the hyper commercialized worlds of film financing, production, and distribution. we’re charting a new course while providing intensive learning opportunities for emerging filmmakers. instead of digging for investors, we’re turning to hundreds of donors. instead of looking to the studios and commercial distributors, we’re partnering with a college and a non profit film producer. and we’re committed to an extensive and unconventional grass roots release for peter and john . we'll show it in big cities, for sure—but we will also take our film down dirt roads to more than 200 small new england towns (including every cape and island town and more than 60 towns in vermont) where we’ll partner with local non profits, send postcards to everybody in town, set up portable projection equipment in grange halls, theaters, museums, libraries, and schools, and lead q & a discussions about our film—and our experience making it. we’re collaborating in ways that go beyond anything we’ve done before. we’re producing a picture that advances the whole idea of “community cinema” by working with hundreds of people, near and far, to help get it made. it's film making in the spirit of an old fashioned barn raising—making a picture that validates place based characters, story, and themes. we believe that people need to tell their own stories. we believe that indigenous film plays a vital role in defining us. risks and challenges we’re breaking ground by making "peter and john" this way. we will undoubtedly face challenges at every turn    weather can alter our schedule, vehicles can break down, ferry boats can be sidelined, even our script might need changes to reflect revelations of character or location. but we’ve done this before and we’re confident and excited as we set out to create a fertile environment for creative discovery. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
