that's why we have decided to publish 6 issues instead of 12. we will feature san diego, california; eastern tanzania (including the hidden island of lamu off the coast of kenya); the 1,000 islands region of canada; sydney, australia; santa fe, new mexico; and san juan, puerto rico. we have chosen these places because they have been on our list for a while and have much to offer the conscious traveler. we also have amazing writers in these areas, who have serious stories to share and incredible content to brag about. by 2019, immersion travel magazine will have undergone a complete revitalization and will have a wealth of resources and stories to share. all we need to make this happen is a strong reader base that is willing to pay $40 a year for honest, reliable content. walking out to the beach from point montara lighthouse hostel, half moon bay, california risks and challenges we had no doubts when we first started working on immersion travel magazine that it would be a long hard road just to get to this point, and after would involve even more guts and gusto than before. we first formed the idea in a room covered in white boards 5 years ago, and have tweaked immersion into a lean, mean, content producing machine. by using a distributed team, a digital publishing platform and local writers for much of our content, we don't just accomplish a lower carbon footprint and a more authentic perspective, we keep our overhead expenses low. by running immersion travel magazine in this low overhead mode and cherry picking destinations, where we have extensive networks of writers and photographers, we are able to keep expenses low while we continue to expand our reader base. we will take slow and conservative steps in expansion, taking on employees and raising our rates for freelancers when our revenue stream can sustain the increased expense long term. our immediate challenge is expanding membership. since immersion travel magazine has no ads in its issues, and no plans to add them in the future, we rely on a single revenue stream. luckily, this is one of our strongest selling points since we can make members our priority, not advertisers. a second hurdle is continued funding. we need 2,000 members paying $40 a year just to keep the lights on. (to put that in perspective, afar magazine has over 260,000 subscribers.) if we fail to sell memberships after this  Jimmy Fraud , we won't be able to budget for future issues. in order to avoid the feast famine cycle, we need to hold membership drives throughout the year and invest in a b market testing to see which campaigns garner the most new memberships. if we can spread renewals throughout the year, we can have consistent cash flow that allows for better planning and production of issues. a final challenge that we have already faced and triumphed over has been the ever changing technology scene. we have designed itm to be a flexible digital platform that can be enjoyed on any device, be it mobile, desktop or tablet. we have written the underlying code to be adaptive to future technological advancements and will continue to adapt as needed. other unforeseen challenges will be met with our teams' adaptability and our lean, agile workflow. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
