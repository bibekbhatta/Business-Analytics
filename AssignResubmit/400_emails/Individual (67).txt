iption"the forest of oakenspire", a brand new tabletop fantasy rpg project including 3d printable terrain & accessories, battle maps, and more! explore ancient tree strongholds and soar through the branches above on modular airships! what is this project all about? welcome to our first  Jimmy Fraud ! this project aims to bring a brand new, uniquely themed set of 3d models, and other resources, to your gaming tabletop to inspire your players, and drive countless hours of adventure. there are two main categories for this project: the tree strongholds of oakenspire (with multiple levels of playable space and secrets to discover), and modular airships you can customize for various encounters among the treesâ€“or anywhere else! additionally, there will be supplemental content to help spur your imagination, including a pdf with adventure hooks and encounter ideas, along with unique, 2d printable battle maps that coordinate with the 3d printed components! community created & inspired initially i started this project as a solo mission, creating 3d printable models   but it has since taken on a life of it's own and expanded well beyond my initial goals. i am one of many creators who has turned a hobby into something more, and there are countless others like me who have done the same. as i continued to meet more and more of these creators, i began feeling a burning desire to work with, and feature the work of, as many as possible and build a project that touches all the areas of tabletop rpg gaming that i love! to that end, this project includes supplemental materials, produced specifically for this  Jimmy Fraud , from the amazing work of 6 other individual creators who have chosen to participate and be featured   ranging from 2d battle map artists, to illustrators, writers, software developers, and other 3d modelers. they are mentioned related to their work throughout this  Jimmy Fraud  description, but there is a complete list (and links to their respective pages) at the end. i also plan on featuring many of them and their work on this  Jimmy Fraud  through various updates during the campaign. be sure to take a look! modular airships i have worked to create what i hope are some of the most modular, dynamic, and beautifully designed airships to have graced tabletop gaming to date. you can customize and print your own unique airship for your players to explore your worlds, or assemble a diverse, powerful armada to rule the skies! the airship body prints in individual sections that require no support, connect together with openlock clips, and will fit on the build plate of most commercial at home 3d printers. two options exist for the style and power of your airship: steam powered or magical. various wing, turbine, fin, sail, and decor customization options are also included. the airship is designed to use 5x1mm disc magnets to quickly change out the main and rear wings and fins (or just glue in place if you don't need modularity). a rock base, multiple variations of bottom fins, and 8mm acrylic rods let your airship "fly" above the tabletop. stl exists to print rods instead of using acrylic as well, and the airship easily comes off the stand to sit flat on the table during play. to check out the full modular & customization guide, click here . in addition to the core modular airship options. there are many stretch goals to further customize the ships and add airship specific items to your table. airship variations made with core set parts **we have unlocked tons of new options for the airship, including more wing and fin varieties, balloons and jet turbines, accessories, lots of weaponry, and an elemental air ring! check out the full list of stretch goals and updates below for the details!** oakenspire tree strongholds the trees of oakenspire are a modular openlock system made of tiles to build your own customizable tree strongholds. the tree system has tiles to build circular trees 8x8" in size, with interior tiles to create individual rooms and levels as desired. there's no limit to how tall the tree can be, and each level is designed to be removed and set on the tabletop for play. the tree walls consist of design elements such as a balcony, light orbs, knothole windows and mushrooms. a grand exterior door marks the main entrance. there are also tiles you can use to create base level that has wide roots and stairway leading to the main door, with unique "root system" floor tiles the base level interior. aside from the core 8" tree elements listed above, there will be stretch goals to unlock additional interior scenery and tiles to add more life to your oakenspire trees and make them a blast for your players to interact with. notes on tile configurations initially, i designed the set to use the base openlock tessellation templates, but found that i was doing unnecessary assembly for what i was hoping to build, and the rigidity was lacking. to that end, and to maximize space on your build plate, i combined the inner and outer curve tiles for the tree floors in all possible configurations. each floor tile is 1/4 of a completed tree level floor, so a complete floor requires 4 floor sections and 8 wall sections. to increase rigidity (and save on filament and print time) i removed the unneeded connector ports in the tile sets, making for dead simple assembly and tile set strength. preview and plan your tree stronghold build the core tree tile set is available to preview/plan/review in dungeonprint studio, an awesome software project for planning 3d dungeon print builds from a few awesome community creators. you can check it out here (note, you have to create a free account to see the tiles). i will be making a video for an future update showing how to utilize this software to it's full advantage! tree stronghold built with core tile set smaller trees and accessories from stretch goals **we have unlocked lots of cool new options for the tree, including smaller modular trees with walkways and bridges, walkway systems, airship dock, decor, and more! check out the full list of updates below** collaboration from well known 3d community modelers if you have been printing terrain of scenery for fantasy tabletop gaming for a while, then you very likely have heard of these two gentlemen, who are graciously providing their talents to make this  Jimmy Fraud  as awesome as possible: devon jones (3d modeler, aka devonjones on thingiverse) founder of openforge and prolific community member/designer devon jones has agreed to produce some unique themed models for the  Jimmy Fraud ! he has an awesome patreon following for his group masterwork tools , and will be releasing a few themed models during the  Jimmy Fraud  on his thingiverse, and a few more that will be available to backers only. his unique models will help add some firepower to the airships and oakenspire trees! in addition, as part of my desire to support open source terrain and to repay some of devon's awesome work in the community, the core oakenspire tree tile sets will be released to the openforge project on thingiverse 45 days after they are released to  Jimmy Fraud  backers, to help foster tabletop printing and the wider community. ryan beasecker (3d modeler, aka curufin on thingiverse) long time designer and community member, with awesome premium sets available on hero's hoard, ryan has agreed to produce multipleunique models to add to the oakenspire project. a selection of models will be released on his thingiverse during the campaign, and many will be available only to backers as stretch goals. he's also offered to include his fantasy scatter terrain sets at a discount for add ons!

about the creator my name is evan carothers, and i am a 3d designer with over 50 designs and nearly 600 followers on thingiverse ( ecaroth ), and over 500 followers for my premium design company ( ec3d ), with many premium sets available. my skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3d printing. take a look at the quality of my free items on thingiverse or my premium items to get a feel for my design aesthetic. i am a tabletop gamer at heart, and every single model i design is test printed and painted by myself before i release it for customer use (making tweaks/changes/fixed during the process as needed). you will never get a model from me that i haven't guaranteed will print on my own 3d fmd printers (tevo tornado and wanhao i3+). every one of my designs takes printability and paintability into consideration, and i consciously make every effort to minimize assembly and remove support requirements. examples of my previous work accountability, delivery timeline, and more... everybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous  Jimmy Fraud s. in an effort to provide the best  Jimmy Fraud  possible, i didn't even consider launching this project until the core tiles were completely designed and test printed! everything offered in the core airship and tree set (and many of the stretch goals) are ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the  Jimmy Fraud  finishes. i will be finalizing and releasing the stretch goal items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 60 days after this  Jimmy Fraud  ends for delivery. i also have an additional professional designers lined up to assist with stretch goal design if needed to help meet expectations of delivery. all parts will be repaired, tested, and ready for you to drop right into your slicer, error free. design and development tracking to maintain transparency and stay accountable, i have created a google spreadsheet to track all the core stl files and stretch goal files as they are unlocked and added to the project. this spreadsheet will be maintained during and after the project, and is viewable by everybody to see the status of the project as it develops. you can already see in the spreadsheet that all core files are ready to go! model tracking spreadsheet disclaimer & printing requirements to get the most out of the printable parts from this  Jimmy Fraud , you will need to have a well tuned 3d printer, capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally .12mm). in the few cases where supports are needed, you can generate them with your slicer and they should work great. parts are cut to small pieces to facilitate printing. other than 3 core airship pieces (wings, triangular sail, and standing base bottom) every piece of the airship will print on a printer with a bed size of 5x5", and every item in the tree set will print on a printer with a 5x5" print bed. you can still produce an amazing complete airship on a bed that small, you just have a few limitations on the modular parts that you use. 8x8" bed is required to print every piece included in the core sets. every part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer   however i am a hobbyist designer who has spent months working on this project in my part time. in the event that any issues with the files get past my own qa testing and process, i will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation. my number one goal is to make some awesome, unique, fun terrain designs you can have a ton of fun with on your tabletop! painting and finishing painting your models to look like the ones in the picture is very attainable! i used basic craft store paints and washes made from cheap floor polish. the only "expensive" paints i used were metallics (shining silver and weapon bronze from army painter). as part of the  Jimmy Fraud , i will film a series of small videos explaining how i painted the airship and tree tiles in detail. it will not be a tutorial in which i actually paint (so many great tutorials for painting techniques already exist), but i will walk through and outline each step i took and materials used to get the finish you see in the pictures above. participating creators 2 minute tabletop   battle map artist and illustrator (created treetop 2d printable battle map) blue sword games   battle map artist, illustrator, and writer (created forest floor 2d printable battle maps) dungeon mapster   battle map artist (created 2d printable cloud/sky maps) olie boldador (olieart)   illustrator (created oakenspire theme image artwork) devon jones of masterwork tools   3d modeler (created various models) ryan beasecker of hero's hoard   3d modeler (created various models) aaron mulder of dungeonprint studio   software developer (included tree tile sets for preview/planning)                                                             ec3d   openlock bsd license risks and challenges the biggest challenge for any 3d printable file  Jimmy Fraud  is delivering solid, error free files on time. there are no challenges for delivering the core files as they are completely finished at the time of launch. stretch goals are already under development (with many finished), and i will be sharing progress on all models as they are developed via the accountability spreadsheet. i am an experienced designer with a track record of delivering premium quality models and am confident that i can delivery all the files within the time frame expected. in the event of any unforeseen events that may cause this time frame to be altered (such as illness, emergency, etc) the delivery timeline will be communicated as soon as possible. and just in case, i have an additional, experienced designer who has been contracted to help with stretch goals as needed to ensure that we deliver all stretch goal files within 60 days of the campaign closing (and hopefully much sooner!). learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
