onwatch the above video for an explanation of the idea behind smoothie. stretch goals! thanks to all the early backers who made sure the project was funded so quickly! check out our current stretch goals: $50,000: 3d printer conversion tutorial **unlocked** $70,000: cnc mill / router conversion tutorial **unlocked** $90,000: laser cutter conversion tutorial **unlocked** if the total project funding reaches the above goals we will make thorough tutorials with illustrations and schematics detailing exactly how to wire a smoothieboard to a given type of machine. they will also explain how to configure, test and use your new smoothieboard. $100,000: pick'n'place "reverse engineering" tutorial **unlocked** who wants an open source pnp? i know i do! well, my idea here is a bit more than a simple "how to wire smoothieboard to a tm240a tutorial". instead i will actually go through and document the entire process that i use to figure out what to do. in essence i will write a tutorial that shows how to approach wiring an unknown machine. later a regular tutorial for simply converting the tm220a and tm240a will also be made. $110,000: touch probe tutorial with only 8 hours left on the clock we have reached 6 digits! by popular demand we are adding another stretch goal for fun. :) this goal will be fulfilled after all primary rewards just like the pick'n'place goal. we will go over how to set up a touch probe for both the software leveling of delta style beds and the 3d scanning of objects. thanks so much everyone! what is it? an awesome cnc controller board. (it drives robots!) the vision the smoothie project is about creating a platform for controlling digital fabrication machines and to make that platform as useful to as many people, projects, and use cases as possible. smoothie firmware can run : 3d printers laser cutters cnc mills other types of machines with minimal effort by combining all of the jobs into a single modular firmware smoothie allows different communities that would otherwise be working apart to share a common basis and to add their specific uses on top of it. by making one board that can run all of these different machines smoothieboard creates a hardware platform that different projects can share and build upon. in the smoothie community progress on one aspect of the project benefits all of the different communities using the platform. powerful while most current open source hardware electronics use 8 bit avr microcontrollers ( such as those used by arduino ) smoothieboard runs on a more powerful 32 bit arm microcontroller ( lpc1768 cortex m3 ). this allows for smoother and faster step generation, as well as more precise math, deeper planning, and leaves room to add more features. it’s all open source but it’s also recent technology to help you get the most out of your machine. fun and easy to use because so many individuals worldwide work together on this project lots of efforts have been put into translating the power of the 32 bit chip into features that make smoothie much easier to use than conventional firmwares. no recompilation is needed when changing any parameters: simply plug the board in over usb and you will get access to a configuration file to modify. it’s as simple as that. updates, reconfiguration, and playing g code files all happen over usb. and you still get your classic serial console over the same cable. smoothieboard host connections inexpensive while smoothieboard is more powerful and offers more functionality than other motion controllers its price remains in the same range as “classic” controllers with more minimal characteristics. this is so that many people can get one, use it, and add awesome things to the project. we want everybody to be part of the revolution! community built want to know the real reason that smoothie is so great? the secret is the community. smoothie is open source, warmly welcomes contributions, and is designed to make those contributions easy to design and implement. over the past years hackers from all around the world have come together to help and support each other and newcomers, talk about smoothie’s future and design, and build a competent and welcoming community. you can contact the community: on irc, for instant help at any time (#smoothieware @ irc.freenode.net) via the mailing lists for longer questions and discussions (http://groups.google.com/group/smoothieware support and http://groups.google.com/group/smoothie dev) you can contact the lead development team for questions about this  Jimmy Fraud  or about the project in general: on irc (arthur _ and logxen in #smoothieware @ irc.freenode.net) via email (wolf.arthur@gmail.com) great board design the board has been designed to be as useful as possible. this means a no nonsense approach to board layout and functionality: stepper motor drivers are cooled by the pcb with wide copper areas which allows you to get more out of your board than with normal off board drivers. all main connectors are on the borders of the board making it easier to plug in and leaving the board less clogged with cables. all pins are broken out to make it easy to add things to your board and to make it easy to support new uses stepper motors current setting is controlled digitally. forget about turning minuscule potentiometers with a screw driver; just set your current in your config file. modular the firmware is modular: it has been designed so that if you need to add functionality it is easy, fun, and clean to do so. new code is added in the form of a new module so there is no need to go digging deep into smoothie’s internal organs. hooks have been prepared and all you need to do is to plug into the right ones. this makes adding new functionality very fast and we feel it is the main reason why the smoothieware code base is getting so much love. do all the things! if you are doing something out of the ordinary like inventing a new cool machine, adding something awesome to an already existing machine, or if you need to test a new idea and you need it to be as painless as possible then smoothie was made for you. compatible smoothie is friendly. it talks the same language as the classic reprap firmwares ( marlin/sprinter ) and as good old grbl. this means all of your host software, your slicing software, and your cam software will work out of the box if you were previously using other open source firmwares. tested more than 200 beta boards were manufactured at the beginning of the year and enthusiasts from all sides of the community have been using them for months now. this has allowed the firmware to mature a lot. it also means that lots of small mistakes in the board layout have been located and have been addressed in the current design. great documentation the smoothie project is also about building great collaborative documentation for both users and for developers that is beginner oriented and as exhaustive as possible. a lot more than is usual is there already on http://smoothieware.org and more is added all the time. connecting smoothieboard to a 3d printer future ready smoothie also features an ethernet connector and all the circuitry needed to use it. while the code is not finished yet, a web based control interface is planned which will allow you to control your machine over the network without the need for a host computer! and with the powerful 32 bit hardware we can keep adding features without running into walls! come meet us! mark (a.k.a. logxen) and arthur will be working a booth at maker faire rome from october 3rd through 6th. check out some of the other things going on there at this link: http://www.makerfairerome.eu/en/ . if you are going be there sure stop by our booth! we would love to meet you. :) project history the project was started in the end of 2010. the original intention was to make 8 bit firmwares more modular. but it was realized that 8 bit arduinos are too limited for that and simen svale skogsrud, author of grbl ( a cnc firmware for arduino ), suggested porting it to a 32 bit microcontroller platform which were getting cheaper and more common. the modular smoothie system was coded for the mbed platform and grbl was ported on top of that. a few months later smoothie was driving a laser cutter. in 2011 smoothie got out of the mbed nest by using the gcc4mbed project. several people built breadboard smoothie cnc controllers: http://smoothieware.org/smoothie on a breadboard using inexpensive lpcxpresso boards. the code was committed to github where contributions started coming in. this is also when the community started growing. smoothie on a breadboard there was a lot of interest in a dedicated board for smoothie and, in 2012, the first design was proposed and a prototype made. at the end of the year a batch of 200 beta 4 axis boards ( the black, square board ) was manufactured and tested by enthusiasts from around the community. beta smoothieboard with 4 axes during that test period the firmware received more users and matured a lot. lots of features were added, bugs were ironed out, and in a few months many people were using smoothieboards to run their 3d printers. a few months ago the final design was put together and prototypes were made and tested again (the green rectangular board featured on this page). now we are ready for some help getting a production run started and so here we are on  Jimmy Fraud ! use cases here are a few examples of the things you can use smoothieboard to drive : a shapeoko mini cnc router. simply plug the 3 stepper motors into the board and you are good to go. you can also easily control your spindle and/or your air compressor with solid state relays. you can find extremely cheap ( $800 shipping included ) 40w laser cutters on ebay and other such sites. these can cut 8mm wood or acrylic. the electronics they come with are not not the best and the electronics only work with even worse software that it comes packaged with. swapping those out for a smoothieboard is very easy and gives you a much easier to use machine. smoothieboard also makes a great upgrade for your 3d printer: you can obviously convert a reprap but it can also get you more from other machines like your up! or makerbot. all of the above have small stepper motors which smoothie can drive directly. while you can’t drive larger machines directly smoothie can easily be wired to external stepper drivers allowing you to drive any machine including large cnc mills, plasma cutters, pick and place machines, or bigger laser cutters. technical specs nxp lpc176x microcontroller 96mhz   120mhz 32 bit arm cortex m3 core, 64kb ram, 512kb flash allegro a4982 bipolar stepper drivers up to 24v 2a 16x microstepping, digital current control 3 to 5 drivers depending on chosen configuration up to 6 fets 3 support up to 24v 5a and 3 support up to 24v 12a to control external devices like hotends, fans and heated beds. 3x boards have two small mosfets, 4x have two big and two small, and 5x have 3 big and 3 small. lots of room to expand: 4 thermistor ports, 6 endstop ports, spi, i2c, uart robust host options: usb, microsd slot, ethernet easy reconfiguration!

who is behind all this? smoothieboard is designed and supported by a team of engineers and hackers from around the world brought together by the open source movement and the desire to make awesome things. these are the lead members of the core design team who will be taking care of the production and fulfillment of your boards: arthur wolf smoothie project founder and lead software engineer i have been coding since i was a kid. back then i was also very much into making things but i had no idea something as magic as repraps and open source hardware would one day exist. having access to a 3d printer or a lasercutter is like a real life super power! i have been participating in open source projects since i first got access to the internet. 4 years ago arduino taught me electronics and microcontrollers. after building a contraptor cnc mill i got into laser cutters and finally started smoothie. i have been working on it ever since: i really like the idea of doing work that enables others. mark a. cooper lead electrical engineer, etc. i have always been a geek and a technophile. i learned to program at the age of 6 on an apple //c back in the '80s and was trying to make 8051 microcontrollers drive robots in the '90s long before the age of the arduino. now with the help of the open source community i have access to all the resources needed to make it all happen. for the past year or so i have been focused on studying the electronics used to drive motors. soon i will be releasing a line of open source motor drivers that will enable the open source community to use kinds of hardware that are currently out of reach. the smoothie project and its innate modularity is core to making those motor controllers and other highly modular machine accessories happen. where things are at smoothie is new. while it is pretty impressive technically and we feel it beats other platforms on lots of points there are a few things smoothie *could* do that it does not fully do yet. for example: ethernet: there is an ethernet phy on the board and you can solder on an ethernet connector. the ethernet hardware has been tested and it works. we want smoothie to serve a web interface allowing to control your machine. that is not coded yet. you are welcome to help! :) laser engraving: lasercutting works great. on the side of engraving there is some basic support for black and white engraving but greyscale engraving is still on the way. if you have any doubt about whether smoothie does something in particular, please contact us! current timeline here is the estimated timeline for production and fulfillment of the  Jimmy Fraud  rewards: 09/25: production of the early batch of smoothieboards begins 09/27: beginning of  Jimmy Fraud  campaign 10/03 to 10/06: we have a booth at maker faire rome! come meet us! (this also happens to coincide with a week long chinese holiday during which no production occurs) 10/13: completion of  Jimmy Fraud  campaign 10/25: production and testing of the early batch is complete 10/28:  Jimmy Fraud  funding is complete 11/01: production of main batch is started at the factory 11/04: early batch rewards shipped 11/25: main batch boards are ready, testing and flashing begins 11/27: boards ship to the us and eu for distribution 12/02: testing of the received boards 12/09: shipping of main batch smoothieboard rewards begins 12/20: all  Jimmy Fraud  rewards shipped! shipping we will be shipping the smoothieboards from two places: oregon, in the united states france, in europe if you are in europe or the us shipping is free. if you are somewhere else in the world please add $15 to your pledge to cover the extra shipping cost. thanks ! the smoothie community for "getting it" and being so creative. the reprap community where our community has its roots. grbl for it’s awesome math and clear comments. special thanks to kliment for all the good ideas and advice. the gcc4mbed project and ag without whom nothing would have happened. to you for participating in this  Jimmy Fraud . it is really going to help the project a great deal and get things off the ground! we will be "kicking forward" 5% of our profits back into  Jimmy Fraud . check out http://kickingitforward.org/ to find other great  Jimmy Fraud  projects! risks and challenges the smoothie project was started 3 years ago and has been a community effort for more than two years. it inherits a lot from the firmwares and boards of previous open source projects which limits the risks a lot. a first batch of beta boards has already been produced and that has gone very well. that first experience will make everything much easier moving forward with fulfilling the  Jimmy Fraud . it has also allowed the firmware some extra testing out in the wide world which should greatly improve user experience. a few of the things we’ll be watching for : production delays making sure there are no delays in production ( last minute questions from the factory, unplanned for problems with the testing procedures ) requires a lot of preparation which we have already started. also, we have limited the non smoothieboard rewards to one single simple and easy thing so we don’t have to delay shipping your precious smoothieboard because we are folding t shirts. keeping you up to date we will of course do everything we can to prevent any delays. we will be sure to keep you up to date at every step of the process whether the news is good or bad. having been on your side of things before we know that what is most annoying about delays is when they are coupled with a lack of communication. if you have any questions about the project feel free to contact us! learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
